ui.settings.help.general_content	<color=#FFFEC0>Quasimorph</color> is a turn-based rogue-like game.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Health Points</color><br>Health is one of the key characteristics. When health points (HP) reach zero, the character dies. To restore health, you can use autodocs, first aid kits, heal wounds with high-quality stabilizing materials, or maintaining a good diet. A high-calorie reserve activates natural regeneration (+1 HP per turn), and zero causes atrophy (-1 HP per turn). Activating the character's abilities also spends calories. Do not be surprised that hunger comes so quickly. The heroes you control are clones with a metabolism cranked up to maximum.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Movement</color><br>Depending on the chosen method of movement, the player receives a different number of action points (AP) per turn. Stealth movement is slow, gives only one AP, but the player gets a stealth bonus and the ability to not spend AP when interacting with doors, objects, or inventory. Normal movement gives two AP, no penalties or bonuses. Running gives three AP, but while running you cannot interact with doors, objects, and inventory. But you can use weapons. Each method of movement consumes its own number of calories.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Perks</color><br>Active perks are triggered automatically when the activation conditions are met. Each ability has its own trigger. After activation, the character receives temporary bonuses and experience, gradually improving that ability. Passive perks are active constantly and also improve if the character performs the actions specified in the perk text: shoots from a certain weapon, moves while overloaded, and so on.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Quasimorphosis</color><br>The level of quasimorphosis increases due to the influence of entities that resides in the bramfaturas of the Solar System planets. These entities are called quasimorphs. The higher the quasimorphosis meter, the more aggressive the enemies. As the meter rises, the subtle and physical worlds come into contact, and quasimorphs gain the ability to move into our reality. During their manifestation, they are invulnerable to weapons and do not attack.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Wounds</color><br>Successful attacks on a character can not only reduce HP, but also cause wounds. To treat wounds, you must use any items that have wound stabilizing or healing properties. However, even a stabilized wound has a chance of infection, so it is useful to use antibiotics or sorbents. A stabilized wound can open again after some time. In this case, you need to repeat the stabilization procedure. Morphine and first aid kits allow you to close all current wounds and can be used from quick slots even while running. Autodoc heals all wounds at once, except for amputated limbs. Particularly strong substances - morphine, alcohol, cigarettes, and gavvakh - can cause addiction. Each type of addiction has its own penalties. Repeated use of the corresponding substance will reset the progress of the addiction, but will not cure it.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Weapons and Armor</color><br>Different types of long-range weapons have different types and consumption of ammunition. Weapons break over time. Study the characteristics of not only weapons, but also ammunition: many of them have special effects. In addition to the usual types of damage, there are composite ones: explosive (blunt and piercing), plasma (cut and fire). The lowest armor value corresponding to the types of damage protects against them. You can always disassemble weapons and armor that are useless to you into spare parts. They can be used to repair the equipment you use. Cloth can be torn into rags which can be used to stabilize wounds, repair clothes and backpacks. Broken weapons cannot be used, broken armor does not increase damage resistance, and the contents of a broken backpack or vest fall out every turn. Accuracy and dodge have upper limits and bonuses for exceeding them. If accuracy becomes greater than 95%, then every 10% above it increases the chance of a critical hit by 1%, after which accuracy decreases to 95%. If dodge becomes greater than 95%, then every 10% above it decreases the chance of getting wounded by 1%, after which dodge decreases to 95%. Armor damage reduction is calculated using a non-linear formula. The higher your armor rating, the less reduction the next armor point will give. You can see by what percentage the armor reduces the damage received in the tooltip by hovering the mouse cursor over your armor ratings at the bottom of the inventory. The same tooltip will show protection against composite damage types. Having sharp weapons in your inventory allows you to amputate limbs. Be careful! Amputation of some body parts is fatal.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Interactive objects</color><br>The elevator is a key object on each floor of the station, it takes the player to the next floor. Useful items can be found in medical and weapon boxes. Autodocs allow you to restore health and heal wounds. To use them, you need at least one charge. You can restore the charge by spending energy batteries. The level scanner allows you to get more information on the minimap. It also uses energy batteries to get more data. Doors can not only be opened, but also closed or blocked. Options for interacting with doors are available by pressing the right mouse button, same for information about enemies.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Factions and missions</color><br>The strength of a faction is determined by two parameters: Power and Technology. Power affects the missions issued by the faction, namely: the number of enemies, the quality of the dropped items and the reward. Power affects the chance of successfully completing a mission without the player's participation, and is also spent on creating new missions. Technology determines the equipment available to the faction, which they can use and sell, and the number of missions that the faction can issue at one time. These parameters increase over time depending on the stations in the faction's possession and the completed missions. If the faction has not issued a reward for a task in full, then it will accumulate credit that can be used for the next barter. Factions and their characteristics can be viewed in the first tab of the Stock Exchange.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Barter and Free Market</color><br>As PMCs are illegal organizations, they are not connected to the system-wide trading network and are not included in the reputation-based economy. However, corporations agree to exchange items with PMCs. Keep in mind that factions will not always accept or sell items at market price, and some items offered by corporations have a fixed value. The items accepted depend on the station where the exchange takes place, and their selection changes over time. Current accepted items can be viewed in the station tooltip, and those sold - in the second barter tab.The game operates on the law of Supply and Demand. Stations use the items they accept to produce goods, and then sell them to other stations. Because of this, the price of barter items can vary greatly. You can view current prices and their dynamics in the second tab of the Stock Exchange. If you have sufficient reputation with the faction, you can directly purchase items from the inventory of stations in the second barter tab. In this case, the first tab will be used to exchange items for faction credit. To exchange without having to visit stations, you can enable Fast Trading in the settings.<br><br>

ui.settings.help.faq_content	<color=#FFFEC0>Trade break</color><br>If your reputation with a faction drops below zero, all your accumulated barter points with that faction will be lost.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Actions</color><br>Special conditions in the game include eating, moving, or taking an action. Actions in this case include: rearranging items in your inventory, reloading and throwing weapons and grenades, interacting with interactive objects, and activating pact abilities.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Weapon and Character Range</color><br>If the target is outside the weapon's range, its properties will not work, and the damage dealt will be reduced for each tile beyond the optimal range. Character range is the range of vision.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Equipment and Repairs</color><br>Weapons and armor wear out over time. If equipment is repaired using spare parts instead of appropriate repair kits, then with each repair, their maximum durability will decrease. Because of this, weapons and armor may become completely unusable.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Shift and Ctrl in inventory</color><br>Moving an item while holding Shift will move all items of that type. If you left-click on an item while holding Ctrl, it will be moved to/from the inventory.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Amputations</color><br>Amputations are the most severe type of injury. They cannot be cured, only stabilized, temporarily removing the damage received, but not the negative effects. Some parts of the body are connected to each other: the thigh and foot, the shoulder and arm. When the upper body is amputated, the lower, adjacent part is also amputated. Vital parts of the body are the head, chest, body, and stomach. Their amputation leads to instant death.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Where are quasimorphs?</color><br>At the start of the game, there are no quasimorphs on Earth, its artificial satellite Tsiolkovsky, as well as on Mars, Phobos and Deimos. In mission types such as Defense, Control, Security quasimorphosis and eccollaps are absent.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Breaking walls</color><br>All walls can be broken if enough damage is inflicted.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Puddles</color><br>Any liquids (water, blood, fuel, poison) can leave behind puddles. If the new puddle is larger or the same size as the old one, the new one will replace the old one. Spilled fuel can catch fire. Puddles of poison are considered dangerous tiles and dry out over time. If any item other than quest ones or pacts ends up in the poison puddle, it will be destroyed.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Items and Fire</color><br>If a floor tile with raw meat catches fire, the meat will become fried. Any other items, except quest items and pacts, will be destroyed.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Add. damaging elements</color><br>A weapon with this property, when destroying cover, deals damage to everyone standing next to that cover.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Add. knockback range</color><br>Weapons with this property push away the target they hit further than any other.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Amputation due to injury</color><br>Weapons with this property have an increased chance of amputation as a wound.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Silencer</color><br>Shooting a weapon with a silencer has a chance to not attract the attention of nearby enemies.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Pierce Chance</color><br>Ammo with this property have a chance to pass through an obstacle (cover or even an enemy) and hit a target behind it.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Pollution Chance</color><br>Ammo with this property have a chance to leave behind a dangerous tile of the corresponding type.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Pain Damage</color><br>Weapons with this property increase damage to the pain meter.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Severe fractures</color><br>Fracture type wounds inflicted by weapons with this property have increased damage.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Severe bleeding</color><br>Bleeding type wounds inflicted by weapons with this property have increased damage.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Attacks nearby</color><br>Weapon with this property additionally hit the left and right tiles closest to the player on either side of the target.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Weapon Throwing</color><br>If you press LMB on an enemy at a distance while holding Shift and with a melee weapon equipped, the clone will throw the weapon at the target. The maximum range of a such throw is 5 tiles, starting from the clone's tile.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Accurate throw</color><br>Throwing a weapon with this property will always hit the target.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Piercing Throw</color><br>A weapon with this property, when thrown, can pass through the target and damage targets behind it.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Wound-inflicting pierce through</color><br>Weapons with this property inflict a wound if the attack pierces the enemy through. The Pierce Chance can be found in the properties of ammo.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Backup Gun</color><br>Weapons with this property increase the critical hit chance by the specified value for weapons in other slots.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Ramp Up Shot</color><br>Weapons with this property increase their rate of fire when firing continuously.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Painful Critical Hits</color><br>Weapons with this property inflict additional pain on critical hits.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Armor Penetration</color><br>Weapons with this property subtract the specified percentage of the target's armor before calculating the damage reduction from the armor.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Field of View</color><br>Weapons with this property modify the clone's field of view to the specified value.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Weapons with their own damage type</color><br>Some types of weapons (plasma, electric, cold) use the characteristics of not loaded ammo, but their own, thus replacing both the damage type and other characteristics. You can view the replacing characteristics during the mission by hovering the mouse cursor over the ammo icon in the upper left corner.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Deleting Modification Projects</color><br>If you reduce all the stats of equipment upgrade projects to base values, then after finishing work on the project, the stats of all equipment already produced under this project will also be reduced to base values, and the project itself will be deleted, thus freeing up the slot.<br><br><color=#FFFEC0>Population</color><br>A station resource responsible for its efficiency. With high/low population, the station produces goods faster/slower. Population grows over time if the necessary resources are available, but can be changed based on the results of a completed mission.<br><br>

tutorial.ecolapse.dialog	The phenomenon in which a creature is torn from the inside and a Quasimorph appears in its place is called an <color=#FFFEC1>eccolapse</color>. On the first turn the newly appeared Quasimorph is invulnerable, it phases between our and their realities. At this moment, it makes no sense to fire at it, it’s better to take a tactically more advantageous position.						
tutorial.pickup_dataidsk.dialog	Valuable items such as production chips and mercenary mind chips justify the costs of using the shuttle. If you find something like this on a mission, we can evacuate you as part of the standard procedure using the elevator or shuttle.						
tutorial.receive_wound.dialog	Injuries are common in combat situations. The first priority is to treat the wound. You can use bandages, splints, or even ordinary rags for that. To obtain a rag, tear up any unnecessary clothing. Autodocs and surgical kits allow you to immediately heal any wound.						
tutorial.receive_infection.dialog	Some wounds can become infected. To prevent this, use sorbent or antibiotics.						
tutorial.zero_starvation.dialog	Your body constantly requires calories for normal functioning. When satiety drops to zero, the atrophy process begins, which continually reduces your health. Simply eat something. Keep in mind that cannibalism is not encouraged but not prohibited, so if you have melee weapons, you can resort to it.						
tutorial.no_ammo_in_weapon.dialog	Almost any weapon consumes ammunition and need to be reloaded. Avoid doing this in the midst of battle because you become vulnerable during the reloading process. Try to find cover.						
tutorial.broken_weapon.dialog	Weapons have a tendency to break with regular and active use. To repair them, you can disassemble other unnecessary weaponry or use a repair kit.						
tutorial.broken_backpack.dialog	Your backpack has torn. I'll remind you this time but try to keep an eye on the condition of your equipment yourself. Contents will constantly spill out from a torn backpack or rig. To repair it, use any available fabric.						
tutorial.mob_throw_grenade.dialog	Enemies can also use offensive grenades. Of course, they do it much worse than our operatives, but there are exceptions. To avoid getting hit by shrapnel, it's better to move to a safe distance and find cover.						
tutorial.peaceful_station.dialog	Since we conduct illegal activities, trade transactions between corporations and participants in the dignitas market are not available to us. But given our influence on the Solar System, corporations are ready to barter with us. <br><br>Different stations require different goods, as soon as we bring them and unload them into the station warehouse, the station owners will be happy to exchange them for some of their own items. The course is certainly extortionate, but it's worth it.						
tutorial.item_production.dialog	The capacity of our mother spacecraft allows us to produce items directly on board. To produce most simple items, we only need a licensed chip. <br><br>There are examples in history of how one corporation tried to introduce an additional fee for each item produced, but as a result of the six-day war, the corporation went bankrupt, and all the others refused such monetization.						
tutorial.first_death.dialog	<color=#FFFEC1>Clones</color> often die on missions, there's nothing to be done about it, but on the other hand, any clone can be reprinted on a <color=#FFFEC1>bioprinter</color>. Plus, we have <color=#FFFEC1>insurance</color> for such cases, which partially compensates for the lost equipment. To do this, find the <color=#FFFEC1>Emergency Case</color> in the Magnum's inventory, right-click on it, and select <color=#FFFEC1>dismantle</color>.						
tutorial.jammer.dialog	This device is a communication jammer, EW-thing, interfering transmitter, name it. It jams some of the communication channels between you and Magnum. Therefore, we cannot send you station minimaps. If you destroy the jammer, the channels will be free and the minimap will be accessible. So don't hesitate, shoot.						
tutorial.toxic_paddle.dialog	Careful! There are acid puddles next to you. They are difficult to notice but they are extremely dangerous. Avoid them or let them dry.						
tutorial.magnumspaceship.dialog	This is the <color=#FFFEC1>HIS Magnum</color> control screen. From here you can access the list of clone operators and the Cargo Hold (Top right corner of the screen). To go to the spacecraft's compartments click on any compartment marker.						
tutorial.weaponstation.dialog	This is a list of weapon modification projects. Here you can select the weapon whose chip you have unlocked and improve its characteristics. Keep in mind that the price of modification is growing exponentially, and the number of projects is limited.						
tutorial.armorstation.dialog	This is a list of armor modification projects. Here you can select the armor whose chip you have unlocked and improve its characteristics. Keep in mind that the price of modification is growing exponentially, and the number of projects is limited.						
tutorial.memorydefrag.dialog	This is a list of class development projects. Here you can select a class and replace its perks with the perks of any other unlocked class. Keep in mind that the development price increases exponentially depending on the number of perks being replaced, and the number of projects is limited.						
tutorial.starmap_with_tradeshuttle.dialog	The barter module allows you to load a trade shuttle and send it to any body of the Solar System. Select a planet or a satellite, look at the required items by the stations, load them via the “Trade Shuttle” under the list of stations and send the shuttle. In a few days it will return with the items received after the barter.						
tutorial.genomeeditor.dialog	This is a list of clone development projects. Here you can choose a clone of the operator whose chip you unlocked and improve its characteristics or even change their personal perk. Keep in mind that the price of development is growing exponentially, and the number of projects is limited.						
tutorial.trainingcenter.dialog	This is a list of operators undergoing training to level up their class perks. The available maximum level for training depends on the unlocked module upgrades.						
tutorial.all_mercs_down.dialog	Bad news, Boss. We have exhausted all our supplies of consciousness chips and no longer have the ability to clone operatives. Our situation is as close as possible to the complete destruction of our company as a structure.<br><br>The only solution available to us at the moment... Is to send you on a mission, Boss.						
ui.dialog.applaunch_message	Welcome to the Quasimorph Early Access! Please remember that the game is actively in development, and the current version does not have all the planned features. You can find information about our upcoming plans on the game's page and in the game's main menu. <br><br>And don't forget about bug reports! Most likely, we are already working on fixes but you can help by reporting bugs through the dedicated section in the main menu. <br><br>Hop into our Discord to discuss the game with us and other players, and receive updates before everyone else.						
ui.dialog.continuetutorial	Do you want to continue training?						
ui.dialog.afterskiptutorial	Supplies on the spacecraft are running low, so we need to find some new profitable <color=#FFFEC1>contracts</color>. We can start working for anyone and make them the dominant power in the System, or we can try to maintain the status quo for the sake of long term profiting from this apocalypse. We can start by returning the <color=#FFFEC1>AnСom's PCPU</color> from our cargo hold to its rightful owners. Or bring it to someone else. Also, if we can land a mighty blow on <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>, there is a chance that he has enemies on <color=#FFFEC1>Venus</color> and they will contact us. It's up to you, <color=#FFFEC1>Boss</color>.						
ui.dialog.jane_boss_killed	...Goodbye, Boss...						
ui.dialog.game_over_approved	Boss, if you leave the mission, you won't be cloned. Are you sure about your decision?						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_1	Good morning, <color=#FFFEC1>Boss</color>. Let's first restore memory after the diapause. During the AnCom mission on Venus, we awakened a quasimorph named <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>. Now his quasimorphs are still in our world, which is weird. There's no information in the news that we're involved.. Meanwhile, corporates insist that quasimorphosis is a fabrication and claim that <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color> is a provocation by <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color>. We are now orbiting <color=#FFFEC1>Phobos</color> and have time to recover and figure out what to do next. The supplies on the spacecraft are running low, so we need to find ourselves some new profitable...						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_2	" <color=#FFFEC1>ATTENTION! ATTENTION!</color> Vector 4, sector 6, northern hemisphere. Five launches detected, rocket engines. Approaching rapidly. Activating countermeasures. <color=#FFFEC1>""Magnum""</color>, grab onto something - it's going to be loud."						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_3	"It seems to be <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color>. We need to clear them out from <color=#FFFEC1>""Magnum""</color>. Our future depends on it."						
ui.dialog.tutorial_diapauseCabin1	Let's remember how to move. To navigate, use {0} on the required square or {1} on the keyboard.<br><br> In the bottom-left corner of the screen, you'll find your energy reserve, pain threshold counter, health, and movement mode. The <color=#FFFEC1>Movement mode</color> determines how many action points you have until opponents take their turn.<br><br> Make sure no one is behind you, press {2} to <color=#FFFEC1>look around</color>. In the closet behind you, you'll find standard equipment, use it.						
 En la esquina inferior izquierda de la pantalla, encontrarás tu reserva de energía, el contador de umbral de dolor, la salud y el modo de movimiento. El <color=#FFFEC1>modo de movimiento</color> determina cuántos puntos de acción tienes hasta que los oponentes realicen su turno.<br><br> Asegúrate de que no haya nadie detrás de ti, presiona {2} para <color=#FFFEC1>mirar alrededor</color>. En el armario detrás de ti, encontrarás equipo estándar, úsalo.	Przypomnijmy sobie, jak się poruszać. Aby poruszać się, użyj {0} na odpowiednim kwadracie lub {1} na klawiaturze.<br><br>						
 W lewym dolnym rogu ekranu znajdziesz swoją rezerwę energii, licznik progu bólu, zdrowie i tryb ruchu. <color=#FFFEC1>Tryb ruchu</color> określa, ile masz punktów akcji, zanim przeciwnicy podejmą swoją turę.<br><br> Upewnij się, że za tobą nie ma nikogo, naciśnij {2}, aby <color=#FFFEC1>rozglądać się</color>. W szafie za tobą znajduje się standardowe wyposażenie, użyj go.	Nasıl hareket edeceğimizi hatırlayalım. Hareket etmek için, gereken karede {0} veya klavyede {1} tuşunu kullanın.<br><br>

ui.dialog.tutorial_diapauseCabin2	Leave the cabin and head to the <color=#FFFEC1>elevator</color>, it's in the room across. We need to eliminate all these bastards.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_diapauseCabin3	If you press key {0}, you can get information about the <color=#FFFEC1>mission status</color> or request <color=#FFFEC1>evacuation</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Evacuation</color> is done via elevator or shuttle. But right now, we have nowhere to retreat...						
ui.dialog.tutorial_diapauseCabin4	To move between station levels, use <color=#FFFEC1>elevators</color> or <color=#FFFEC1>stairs</color>. In the elevator control window, all floors connected by the elevator shaft are displayed. Press the floor you need. I strongly recommend starting with the <color=#FFFEC1>Medbay</color>. If we lose the <color=#FFFEC1>bioprinter</color>, there will be serious difficulties in cloning you or other fighters.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock1	This is the <color=#FFFEC1>Medbay</color>, where the <color=#FFFEC1>bioprinter</color> is located. A perfect place to remind you about your health. If your health reaches zero, you will die. If your pain threshold reaches its limit, you will skip a turn. Damage you receive can lead to injuries or limb loss. Keep an eye on that. Take a close look at the health interface by pressing the {0} key.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock2	I'm sending a signal to your computer about a new <color=#FFFEC1>wound</color>; you need to fix it. To do this, press {0} on the medical kit to your right, then select the injured body part.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock3	It seems you've acquired an <color=#FFFEC1>infection</color>. Open your inventory by pressing {0} and use a <color=#FFFEC1>sorbent</color> or <color=#FFFEC1>antibiotic</color>. If the wound is not fixed, the <color=#FFFEC1>infection</color> develops faster.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock4	In extreme cases, you can perform an <color=#FFFEC1>amputation</color>. To do this, select 'amputate' in the context menu of a <color=#FFFEC1>sharp object</color> and choose the <color=#FFFEC1>body part</color>. Note that you can't bandage yourself while in sprint mode.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock5	<color=#FFFEC1>AutoDoc</color> allows you to treat wounds or infections if it has <color=#FFFEC1>charges</color>. You can recharge it with standard <color=#FFFEC1>batteries</color>. Hurry, I've spotted an <color=#FFFEC1>enemy</color> in the room below you. Deal with them.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock6	Great job. Pay attention to the body. Click on it to <color=#FFFEC1>loot</color>. If you want to <color=#FFFEC1>stand on the corpse</color> without inspecting it, use {0} for movement. When you're done here, return to the elevator and descend to the next level. In the top right corner, there's a <color=#FFFEC1>minimap</color> and the current <color=#FFFEC1>mission status</color>. Use these buttons if you forget what's happening.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_arsenal1	And here's our <color=#FFFEC1>arsenal</color>. Ammo and melee weapons have different <color=#FFFEC1>damage types</color>, and armor has different <color=#FFFEC1>resistance types</color>. Choose wisely with what and how to attack to win.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_arsenal2	Let's make sure your <color=#FFFEC1>weapon</color> is loaded and ready for battle. To reload your weapon, press {0}. If the ammo is in the <color=#FFFEC1>tactical vest slot</color> in the middle of the screen, press the corresponding quick-access slot key, and reloading will take fewer turns.<br><br> You have two <color=#FFFEC1>weapon slots</color>. You can quickly switch between them by clicking on the image of the active weapon in the top left or by pressing the {1} button.

ui.dialog.tutorial_arsenal3	I suggest hiding behind the <color=#FFFEC1>cover</color> to make it harder for enemies to hit us. To do this, stand on the highlighted square.<br><br> The <color=#FFFEC1>cover</color> can stop a bullet if you're not shooting directly from behind it. If your shooting trajectory intersects the cover, it will be highlighted in red.						
 Die <color=#FFFEC1>Deckung</color> kann eine Kugel stoppen, wenn du nicht direkt von dahinter schießt. Wenn deine Schussbahn die Deckung kreuzt, wird sie rot markiert.	Je suggère de se mettre à l'abri derrière la <color=#FFFEC1>couverture</color> pour que les ennemis aient moins de facilité à nous toucher. Pour ce faire, placez-vous sur la case en surbrillance.<br><br> La <color=#FFFEC1>couverture</color> peut arrêter une balle si vous ne tirez pas directement derrière lui. Si la trajectoire de tir croise l'abri, il sera mis en surbrillance en rouge.						
 假如你不直接从<color=#FFFEC1>掩体</color>的后面射击，其可以挡子弹。如果弹道与掩体相交，它将以红亮显示。							
ui.dialog.tutorial_arsenal4	Great. Here's some more useful information. If you ever want to shoot somewhere other than the enemy, hold {0}. Your cursor will change to a <color=#FFFEC1>crosshair</color>, and the shooting trajectory will be displayed.<br>We have a <color=#FFFEC1>fuel barrel</color> for the flamethrower; you can blow it up with a shot... Just don't catch fire yourself. <color=#FFFEC1>Fire is very dangerous!</color>						
ui.dialog.tutorial_arsenal5	To the right of the active weapon is the button to select the <color=#FFFEC1>shooting mode</color>. Hover the cursor over it to see the advantages and disadvantages of each.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_machineBlock1	Someone threw <color=#FFFEC1>grenades</color> into the Machine Room again; I'll deal with them later. <color=#FFFEC1>Grenades</color> are used from the <color=#FFFEC1>utility belt slots</color>. Activate grenade usage with the corresponding hotkey or pressing {0}. Once you're done here, head to the <color=#FFFEC1>cubecentric engine</color> on the left.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_machineBlock2	<color=#FFFEC1>Colnodes</color> have barricaded themselves in the upper compartment. Get ready for a serious battle. Use cover and don't play the hero. We have several stationary <color=#FFFEC1>turrets and mines</color>. They are used in the same way: from the inventory with {0}. Opening the context menu, you need to select <color=#FFFEC1>‘use’</color>. Turret or mine in this case will be installed in the cell next to you - in the direction you are facing. Prepare for defense; we have a little time.<br><br>Just in case, the key for skipping a turn is {1}. It might be useful if you need to wait for a few turns.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_machineBlock3	Destroy them before they blow up the <color=#FFFEC1>Cubecentric Engine!</color> Use everything I've already told you, the goal is to protect the <color=#FFFEC1>‘Magnum’</color>.						
ui.dialog.tutorial_end	Well done, <color=#FFFEC1>Frank</color>. All invaders eliminated, and <color=#FFFEC1>‘Magnum’</color> is no longer under threat. See you at the <color=#FFFEC1>Bridge</color>. Over and out.						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_4	We can certainly do as <color=#FFFEC1>Jane</color> said. Contracts are waiting. But as the saying goes: <color=#FFFEC1>'Honor is lost, everything is lost; honor is preserved, everything is preserved.'</color>. We were able to track down the exact locations of the shuttlepods launches - it's <color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color>. Most likely, <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> has set up a training center and a transshipment point there. Before we start chasing money, I suggest to stick a red-hot poker in the red's ass.						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_5	Great, I'm glad that honor is not an empty word to you, <color=#FFFEC1>Boss</color>. Just in case, I'll remind you about the standard mission preparation interface. On this screen, you choose the operative who will go on the mission, the chip with combat skills that will be integrated into the freshly printed clone, and the equipment that we will issue to the fighter for the mission.						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_6	This is the <color=#FFFEC1>bioprinter screen</color>. Here you can choose a fighter to go on a mission. The list includes both those who survived previous missions and those who need to be printed. Each of the fighters has their own parameters and unique <color=#FFFEC1>talent</color>. They have all been through a lot during years of combat in every corner of the <color=#FFFEC1>Solar System</color>.						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_7	This is the <color=#FFFEC1>class selection screen</color>. In addition to their own experience, each fighter will benefit from gaining a specific set of skills based on the experience of past military conflicts and digitized experience of special forces. Each <color=#FFFEC1>class</color> has a set of passive abilities and trigger abilities that are activated under certain conditions.						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_8	Now you need to <color=#FFFEC1>gather your equipment</color>. Take whatever you deem necessary, but don't forget ammo, food, and medical supplies. Note that if the operative you send dies in battle, all the items will be lost, and <color=#FFFEC1>evacuation</color> is only possible when the <color=#FFFEC1>mission is completed</color> or we find something valuable like a new <color=#FFFEC1>consciousness chip</color>.						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_9	Great, if you feel ready, it's time to press the <color=#FFFEC1>Start Mission</color> button.						
ui.dialog.tutorial2_cargodock1	Our scanners see several ways to solve this problem. First, there is the main <color=#FFFEC1>elevator</color> connecting the <color=#FFFEC1>Cargo Dock</color> to the <color=#FFFEC1>Control Center</color>, but the number of biosignatures at the <color=#FFFEC1>elevator</color> is extremely high. Obviously, there is a quite <color=#FFFEC1>strong security</color> there. Secondly, there is a bypass route through the <color=#FFFEC1>stairs and warehouse level</color>. I would recommend using the second option as our main plan, but if you feel confident, you can act as you think best.						
ui.dialog.tutorial2_cargodock2	Some room nearby is an <color=#FFFEC1>Elevator</color>. Be careful, the signatures of stationary turrets and heavily armored <color=#FFFEC1>colnodes</color> are clearly tracked there. Whatever kills them can kill you too. You are not special, and equipment tends to run out.						
ui.dialog.tutorial2_cargodock3	These <color=#FFFEC1>stairs</color> leads to the warehouse premises. We have enhanced the resolution capability of the geoscanner, there's medical supplies and some other equipment there. Use everything, and you will easily reach the <color=#FFFEC1>SD control center</color>.						
ui.dialog.tutorial2_cmdcenter1	Finally, you're at the <color=#FFFEC1>SD control center</color>. It's full of <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> fighters. A bioscanner is registering spikes in their endocrine systems - it's madness. Maybe there's a way to bypass them? Pay attention to the technical corridors and ventilation shafts. If you picked up <color=#FFFEC1>heavy weaponry</color> from the warehouse, you shouldn't have many problems. Once you find their <color=#FFFEC1>PCO control computer</color>, just destroy it with whatever's at hand.						
ui.dialog.tutorial2_cmdcenter2	Great job. Pilots began maneuver as soon as the geoscanner beeped that the <color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color> guns died. Mission accomplished. Request <color=#FFFEC1>evacuation</color> and return to the nearest <color=#FFFEC1>elevator</color>.						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_10	In front of you, there is a map of the <color=#FFFEC1>Solar System</color>. Here you can see which <color=#FFFEC1>missions</color> are available in different areas and how much <color=#FFFEC1>time it will take to travel</color> from one point to another. Right now, to deliver the PCPU with quasimorphic research to <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>, we need to go to <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color>. Boss... One more thing. The system is open to us and full of possibilities. You are under no obligation to return the device to its rightful owner. But I wouldn’t risk getting involved with <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>. And... This is the last piece of advice that I gave you.						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_11	Choose the <color=#FFFEC1>Rebus Sky City</color> to visit. It's a <color=#FFFEC1>peaceful station</color>, so there's no need to equip the operative who will go there. Also, when we send clones to perform <color=#FFFEC1>barter</color>, we load all the items into the shuttle, so there's no need to make multiple trips if something is forgotten. When you are ready, take the <color=#FFFEC1>PCPU</color> with the research and send the operative.						
ui.dialog.return_ancom_data.AnCom1	Have you brought us our <color=#FFFEC1>intellectual property</color>? Great. Find our representative here at the station and deliver the <color=#FFFEC1>PCPU</color>. To do this, click on the <color=#FFFEC1>pile of boxes</color> next to him. Place the PCPU in the opened inventory window and press the <color=#FFFEC1>“Exchange”</color> button. This is how <color=#FFFEC1>barter</color> works at all peaceful stations where you are allowed to land. When you’re done, return to the shuttle and get out of here. 						
ui.dialog.return_ancom_data.AnCom2	Good work, <color=#FFFEC1>mercenary</color>. If you need contracts, we regularly distribute them through the <color=#FFFEC1>SBN</color> channels. Work for us and you will become rich. But if you stand in our way, the consequences will be dreadful. I hope we understood each other.						
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_12	I can't stand these corporates... <color=#FFFEC1>Boss</color>, what next? It seems like you and <color=#FFFEC1>Frank</color> have satisfied your sense of justice. We're free now. There's chaos all over the System. Taking advantage of the sudden appearance of <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorphs</color>, the corporations have reshuffled the market. Stations change owners almost every day. <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>, who seems to favor us for its awakening, is squeezing the corporations on <color=#FFFEC1>Venus</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> has been showing some furious activity around <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color>. Maybe we should continue fighting against them if we get paid for it? There's no <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorphosis</color> there, so it will be easier.<br><br>We can start working for anyone and make them the mighty power in the System, or we can try to maintain the status quo for the sake of long-term profit from this apocalypse. Also we can decide that Tezctlan is too big a threat to all humanity. We can start fighting against him, hoping that someone will join us. It's up to you, <color=#FFFEC1>Boss</color>.						
ui.dialog.ksiomara_orbit_1	Is that you? I remember you. I've been waiting, hoping that you would show up again. And here you are. You've come close enough to Gannix for my call to reach your mind. But this proximity is not enough for us to make a pact. Do not fear, it will be beneficial for both of us. We have something to offer each other. Do you know why Quasimorphosis occurs in the solid realm? Why the barons come to you? To meet me, go to Venus and simply do your job. Massacre them the way you always do. Murders, cannibalism, people screaming in agony. I will sense the sweet aroma of Gavvakh, and I will know it's you. And I will come to you in person. Then we will discuss the terms of our alliance.						
ui.dialog.ksiomara_venus_gift1	Oh yeah, I'm coming. Agony, the cries of the dying, pain leaving your bodies with the blood - all this in the solid realm looks very different inside Gannix. To us, it is a sweet-voiced choir of ecstasy. Gavvakh flows out of your bodies with blood, torment, and life itself. It streams through your realm and seeps into ours. And we can drink it. Taltnoms crave Gavvakh. Taltnoms want Gavvakh.<br><br>Gavvakh gives us power. Once we are satiated with Gavvakh, we can tear through the invisible fabric separating our realm from yours. First, we whisper to you. Then, we tempt you. Then, we change you. And finally, when you have been turned into our servants and Gavvakh is flowing, we can reveal ourselves. We do not lose our immortality. Our death in Kenom is merely an exile back to Gannix.<br><br>So when you killed me on Mercury, I did not die. Accept my gift, and we will make a pact. You will become my servant. I will give you the power to resist Tezctlan and protect the solid realm, your realm. Now finish the job you came here for. I will help you.						
ui.dialog.ksiomara_orbit_2	I granted you the Skull of the Feathered Serpent so that you could make a pact with me. It is already on the way to your Ethereal Ship						
ui.dialog.ksiomara_pact_activated	"Finally! You have kept your end of the bargain. From now on, we are bound by an unbreakable pact. Together, we will destroy Tezctlan. We must do this! Once a freedom fighter, first among equals in the emerald crystal of Gannix, the king has gone mad. He must be stopped. He dreams of the Emerald Empire, wishes to expand it beyond Gannix. But he himself had once fought against an insane tyrant possessed by the same delusions.<br><br>I will stay in your realm, on Venus. I will gather the Taltnoms loyal to Liberty and fight the madman here. You must head to Mars. There's a place you call Sinkhole Oasis. It's an ancient battlefield. Long before a human ancestor looked up to the stars in fear, a battle took place there. Tezctlan himself took part in it. He emerged victorious, but there he lost his spear. Itzpapalotl, the symbol of the ruler's fate in the Emerald Kingdom, was forever cast on Mars. If you acquire this spear, it is with its help that you will be able to defeat the madman. For your realm, it is salvation from the monster, for Gannix, it is the path to freedom."""						
ui.dialog.tezctlan_pact_activated	Fool! I am Tezctlan, the emperor of eternal Gannix, the lord of the boundless Emerald Empire, the scourge cutting the thread of fate, the leader of legions flying the banners of eagle, jaguar, boa constrictor, and caiman! I am the one who has experienced worship, I am the one who will take Gagtungr's place, I am the one who is truly worthy to rule the Solar System. I am the punishment sent by the universe. Bow your head, mortal. Submit. Accept your fate. In a realm devoid of the golden light of the Sun, the green radiance of Gannix will bring life and death.						
ui.dialog.realware_denied	Magnum, listen up. This is the head of security at the Sinkhole Oasis geological station. I'm speaking on behalf of the RealWare Corporation. RealWare is committed to the open market and NCE regulations, unlike you. Your visit to the station is not in our interest. You have nothing to offer us. If you don't change course within the next 30 seconds, the artillery of our planetary defense system will blast your HIS to atoms. The countdown starts. Over and out.						
ui.dialog.jane_denied	"Translating from corporate to human, Boss. There's definitely something beyond the scope of the geological station's work at Sinkhole Oasis. RealWare will only let us in if they trust us enough. We'll have to do some work for them if we really need to get in there."""						
ui.dialog.jane_sinkhole_visited	This is a peaceful visit, weapons are prohibited. However, RealWare trusts us enough to let us wander around the station in search of something interesting. We've switched Magnum's geoscanner to passive mode to avoid drawing unnecessary attention. So, search the old-fashioned way. Maybe there's a poorly guarded emergency exit or something. Lady Xiomara sent us here for a reason. Be careful, remember that you literally shoved your arm into RealWare's mouth.						
ui.dialog.jane_sinkhole_find_ladder	Yes, this is what we've been looking for. The staircase leads to the inner chambers, and it seems there's no alarm here. We can infiltrate the place relatively unnoticed. However, if you run into any security operatives, they will shoot to kill. Stay cautious and only go down after you're ready for a combat mission.						
ui.dialog.jane_sinkhole_condition	Find the Spear of Tezctlan						
ui.dialog.sinkhole_ladder_denied	The owner of the station will do not like if you use this backdoor. You should better stay in the safety zone.						
ui.dialog.jane_sinkhole_after_ladder	We're utilizing the surprise effect to its fullest. Our techies have hacked into Sinkhole Oasis servers and are overloading its network with information noise. You have some time to figure out what's going on here. Find the spear Lady Xiomara mentioned, and gather any valuable data if possible.						
ui.dialog_jane_see_monolith	What do you see? When you switched to direct actions, we activated the geoscanner. As soon as we scanned the room you're in, it froze up, outputting data that gave our operator a seizure. What on earth is in there? No wonder RealWare is so diligently filtering access to Sinkhole Oasis. Maybe you need to destroy this bloody thing and retrieve the spear from it.						
ui.dialog_jane_attacked_monolith	Well, that was a bad idea. A very bad idea. Firstly, you didn't budge a single atom of this thing with your shot. Secondly, the alarm went off. All armed RealWare security operatives are heading your way. We need some information on this Monolith. Gather it, and we'll get you out.						
ui.dialog_jane_sinkhole_data_taken	Excellent, this data should suffice. We didn't get the spear, but we can plan our next moves. Return to the elevator; we'll figure out a way to get you out. Let's hope for the best.						
ui.dialog.sinkhole_mission_failed	We managed to come up with some excuses, but RealWare still suspects us. Our reputation has been compromised.						
ui.dialog.jane_after_sinkhole	The data we acquired suggests that this entire Monolith is nothing but a phased feature. But first of all, this event occurred about a billion years ago, and secondly, it completely defies the laws of our universe. We're not the first to try breaking it. RealWare has tried every weapon available to them, including a controlled nuclear blast. The result has always been the same - no result. Looks like we have nothing...						
ui.dialog.eipschwitz_after_sinkhole	Exactly. You understand NOTHING! This is a priceless find. The Monolith not only phased into our realm from the bramfatura of Mars, but at the time of phasing, it was something entirely different than just a stone. Your problems won't be solved by anyone other than Dr. Eipshwitz. Since I'm now traveling on your spacecraft, can I finally be considered your employee? Let's get closer to mutually beneficial cooperation. NCE. Freedom to contract. Remember?<br><br>Well, well... I'll need my Telefaturic Dislocator, several boxes of spare parts and repair kits, and I'll need a lab space on the spacecraft and a lab coat... Ah, no. No coat needed. But a couple of handy assistants are.<br><br>Where did I put the Dislocator? You didn't take it back from Mercury? Hm... seems it should still be at Flat Obsidian, in the field camp. We need to evacuate it from there so I can get to work.						
ui.dialog.eipschwitz_see_dislocator	I distinctly remember it standing right here! It was stolen! Those filthy colnodian hands think they have the right to touch my property? This is very fragile and infinitely valuable equipment! Search the whole damn station, it's gotta be here somewhere. I need i… I mean, we need it!						
ui.dialog.eipschwitz_see_dislocator_parts	What?! Barbarians. Vandals. One, two, three, four, ten, sixty-two. The Dislocator was perfectly dismantled into four parts! Four! Even a colnode with one hand and no thumb can count to four! These idiots have destroyed a masterpiece of human thought! They've pushed all modern science back to the Stone Age! I'll have to start development practically from scratch again. So... I need alloys, microchips, nails... Yeah, maybe four or eight this time? We need to consider our previous experience... Yes... Hm...						
ui.dialog.ruins1_realware	Embraced by the mission of the Blood Warriors, from the beginning we know the Realm of Ur, a realm that lies beyond the boundaries of the physical universe. This is our true fatherland. We know Urparp, guardian of the Bright Throne of Gagtungr. To Him we give the glory that comes from our mouth. We also know the created realm. To it we send our curses. We serve the Conqueror Worm, who bestowed the title of Blood Warriors upon us. From the beginning, we remember Him, the father of our spirit, the Ancient Terror for the Manifested Realm. Embraced by the mission of the Blood Warriors, from the beginning we feel Enkidu, rising through us from the bonds of Creation.						
ui.dialog.ruins3_realware	"Warriors! We were born to die on the battlefield. Our flesh is bound in steel to the will of Lord Urparp! Death to the enemies of the Lord!"""						
ui.dialog.ruins3_jane	I'm making a cautious assumption that our invasion of Sinkhole Oasis triggered some mechanisms similar to what we've seen on Venus before... I highly doubt, Boss, that what we are doing will benefit us or humanity.						
ui.dialog.jane_see_dislocator_parts	"I guess the doctor will be incapable of normal human communication for a while. Anyway, let's try to grab anything even remotely resembling ""a true work of art"" and get you out of there. Looks like colnode reinforcements have arrived, so we'll have to fight our way back again."						
ui.dialog.urparp_arise	I've seen things you people wouldn't believe… Myriads of Demons on fire off the shell of Ur… I watched ancient rituals that glitter in the dark near the Red and Gold Throne. All those moments will be lost in time, like specks of dust in the Red Desert… Time to die.						
ui.dialog.urparp_death	I am a god! How can you kill a god? What a magnificent, dizzying innocence! How could you be so naive?! My shackled consciousness is now free, my kingdom is awakening with me. The hour of war is coming, human.						
ui.dialog.jane_after_urparp_death	We lost contact with you precisely for... 48.1 minutes. Whatever you've seen or encountered, we need to evacuate you and the spear. Take it and get back to the elevator.						
ui.dialog.ancom_after_ancom_quest	Greetings, mercenary. We have been monitoring your HIS whenever possible. While evaluating your usefulness, we wanted to be able to contact you immediately. The time has come. You might be interested in another short-term contract. The task is simple: reclaim our property once again. You have shown that you are quite good at it. The mission target: <color=#FFFEC1>Oddibjord-3</color> colony on <color=#FFFEC1>Venus</color>. All the details have already been uploaded to the Magnum. You can start whenever you are ready. End of transmission.						
ui.dialog.jane_after_ancom_hire	Boss, the digital sequences of the contract issued to us by <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> are partially generated or rewritten. If I may say, the contract looks somewhat suspicious. It is likely that the mission is not about reclaiming, but rather seizing someone else’s property. Considering that most of the assets on Venus previously belonged to the <color=#FFFEC1>Fresco</color> corporation, I suspect we are after something from their advanced research. This is a tempting target for many. Thus, we may find ourselves at the center of a conflict among several corporations.						
ui.dialog.caa_jane_after_realware_killed	"These are <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color> operatives, Boss. Signatures are disabled, but everything is clear here. I bet they're looking for the same thing that we are. I'll take a long sip from my ""I told you so"" mug while I'll be sending this data to AnCom. Let's see their reaction."						
ui.dialog.ancom_after_realware_killed	We confirm this is a small task force of <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare Sec</color> fighters. Their <color=#FFFEC1>corporate transponders</color> are turned off which means they are not covered by <color=#FFFEC1>NCE</color>. Such episodes among the hexarchs are rare, but this is a good chance to obtain information about the true balance of power in the System.<br><br>To facilitate the fulfillment of the contract we dropped two autonomous capsules with resources and promising prototypes from the Unveiled. A great opportunity for you to complete the mission, and for us to conduct field tests. The main goal of the contract does not change. We don't see anything you can't handle.						
ui.dialog.caa_jane_after_lift_crashed	I detect the signal! You're still alive. The elevator collapsed to the lower level of Oddibjord-3. The device must be <color=#FFFEC1>somewhere nearby</color>. I detect very powerful bursts of quasimorphic activity throughout the entire floor. Looks like you'll have to fight your way out.						
ui.dialog.caa_reaper_onplayers_sight	Why are violence and sanctity so intertwined? Why is death necessary for life to continue? The master warned that someone would come for the <color=#FFFEC1>Crystal Skull</color>. And he even predicted that it would be the messenger of the one thanks to whom he came to life again in your world. I'm not sorry that you decided to turn your weapons against <color=#FFFEC1>the Emerald Emperor</color>. Your blood will give me new power.						
ui.dialog.caa_jane_after_reaper_kill	There must be a quasimorphic artifact nearby. Take it and return to the shuttle. This is exactly what we were sent for. <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color> reinforcements are arriving to Oddibjord-3, you need to get out of there quickly.						
ui.dialog.caa_realware_archieve_enter	I broadcast on an open channel. You are good for a mercenary. You should have thought about collaborating with RealWare. AnCom are murderers and scammers. It's too late now. The entire sector is under our control, this time you will be eliminated before the task is completed.						
ui.dialog.caa_realware_communications_enter	Open channel. It's a pleasure doing business with you. Our soldiers have not received such combat experience since the Calypso incident. I hope you're not going to give up. Over and out.						
ui.dialog.caa_jane_player_see_last_ladder	When you'll get to the ground level <color=#FFFEC1>immediately</color> move towards the shuttle. RealWare reinforcements have already taken up defensive positions along the entire perimeter. There are a lot of them there. Pull yourself together and do the best you can.						
ui.dialog.caa_ancom_player_enter_surface	Attention, <color=#FFFEC1>HIS Unveiled</color> is speaking! «Magnum», we have to inform you that the mission has been <color=#FFFEC1>cancelled</color>. Unfortunately, the contractual obligations will be revoked. We observe a large concentration of the enemy in the mission area. A decision was made to launch a tactical nuclear strike. Goal: protection of intellectual property of AnCom corporation. The costs are considered justified. Your presence in Oddibjord-3 from now on is considered a violation of the AnCom Information Security Protocol. Public Declaration Article 12, Section C, Paragraph 3. Over and out.						
ui.dialog.caa_jane_player_enter_surface	Sensors detected the activation of the HIS Unveiled thrusters. This is an AnCom spacecraft in orbit around Venus. The approximation shows reaching the position for dropping the bomb from orbit on Oddibjord-3. They don't have enough time to aim accurately, so you'll be hit only with debris, a shock front, and EMP. Bastards. Run to the shuttle and don't break the damn thing.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_agent_contact_trigger	Greetings, comrade. You have been active throughout the Solar System lately. It was simply impossible not to notice you. Also we have noticed that you are not averse to working for the benefit of the working people. So let's cooperate! My name is <color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color>, I am the commander of the <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> in the <color=#FFFEC1>Inner System</color>. And I offer you a job.<br><br>My <color=#FFFEC1>colnodes</color> have infiltrated in the most unexpected assets of the Inner System. Including the orbit of <color=#FFFEC1>Earth</color>. I've managed to obtain data for faking the SBN transponder. It will allow you to get close to the <color=#FFFEC1>Heritage</color> station.<br><br>Our agent <color=#FFFEC1>Justas</color> will be waiting for you at the station, take the <color=#FFFEC1>Red Chip</color> from him. This is a special generative virus, the task of which is to transmit a counter-revolutionary message to all people of the System, and then... to deprive the corporate oppressors of the means of communication. Let's shut the mouths of the enemies of the working class!						
ui.dialog.manifesto_jane_on_arrive	We've been spotted. Now all the PMC spacecrafts in the area have received the promise of a huge reward for your elimination. And many have responded kind. The mission is starting to look like our usual work. Find <color=#FFFEC1>Justas</color>, take the <color=#FFFEC1>Red Chip</color>, and make your way to the server.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_jane_ustas_found	It seems that <color=#FFFEC1>Justas</color> has been exposed, which is what caused the alarm. This does not affect our mission. Take <color=#FFFEC1>the Chip</color> to unlock the elevator.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_jane_chip_taken	The <color=#FFFEC1>Red Chip</color> has to be plugged in the <color=#FFFEC1>mainframe</color>. I hope the Civil Resistance programmers did their job well. The elevator is unlocked, get going.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_jane_elevator_blocked	The alarm is blocking the elevator. We need to <color=#FFFEC1>find Justas</color>, he should have high access.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_jane_computer_center	The SBN has doubled the reward. Of course, our colleagues who were still on the sidelines will not miss such a chance. In addition to them, an operational group of <color=#FFFEC1>SBN Security Service</color> is heading your way. Pull yourself together, it's going to get rough.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_jane_first_elite_killed	One of the squads has been successfully eliminated, but don't relax. I'm picking up another group on sensors.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_jane_second_elite_killed	Oh, that's good. Should be a little easier now. The SBN will probably concentrate their best units in the <color=#FFFEC1>server room</color>.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_jane_control_room	The mainframe is very close. I'm afraid you'll have to fight your way through crowds of SBN operatives to get out.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_cres_contact_chip_used	The mainframe turned out to be more secured than I expected. You will have to <color=#FFFEC1>protect it</color> until the virus breaks through the defenses.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_jane_chip_used	What the hell! The elevator is blocked again. You won't get out of here until the virus has dealt with the computer.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_jane_mainframe_no_chip	You need the <color=#FFFEC1>Chip with the virus</color>, don't waste time!						
ui.dialog.manifesto_cres_contact_event_ended	Comrades! It is time to stand up to our oppressors! The corporations will feel the wrath of the working people! We, the workers, are the only ones who sweat and bleed for the good of humanity. The only ones who can turn matter into something. We are the <color=#FFFEC1>Templars of the proletariat</color>! We give ourselves for the great purpose. For the sake of transforming the world from a state of chaos into a place for people to live! Without us, there will be no peace for those who oppress us to enjoy!<br><br>We fought during the <color=#FFFEC1>Great Anarchist Revolution</color> on both sides of the barricades. We trudged through the black mud of the Earth, our flesh was torn from our bones by the dust storms of Mars. And all this not for awards or glory. Only for the just cause that each of us believes in. When the states fell, what did the new order give us? Instead of the promised liberation, we were faced with new slavery.<br><br>But no one managed to break us! Listen to our message! Kill the nearest manager, seize the shuttle and go to the nearest Civil Resistance station! Do everything in your power. Let the Solar System be engulfed in the sacred fire of counterrevolution!						
ui.dialog.manifesto_jane_event_ended	What pretentious nonsense... But I suppose it's a success. All station systems are unlocked, and we can <color=#FFFEC1>evacuate</color> you according to standard protocol.						
ui.dialog.manifesto_cres_contact_after_completed	The immune response of the <color=#FFFEC1>SBN Network</color> was stronger than we expected. However, our virus has <color=#FFFEC1>evolved</color>. People all over the Solar System will now receive <color=#FFFEC1>our callings</color>. It will take the SBN years to catch it.<br><br>And one more thing, comrade. Earth no longer seems like an invulnerable sacred cow to anyone. The fires of a <color=#FFFEC1>new war</color> are about to flare in its orbit. Thank you.						
ui.dialog.return_ancom_data.Tezctlan2	You continue to serve me. This is the right choice. New gifts that will give me new knowledge about the solid realm. The ruler of the Emerald Empire will remember you.						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_tezctlan_after_ancom_quest	You awakened me, you believed in me. You gave me information about my enemies in the solid realm. You have earned my attention. But you are but a mortal, leading other mortals into battles. You must prove yourself worthy of taking a place in the ranks of the <color=#FFFEC1>Emerald Empire</color> army. The Great and Accepted Poison Knight <color=#FFFEC1>Ilhutl</color>, one of my servants, is now on Venus. He will be waiting for you in the <color=#FFFEC1>Feathered Temple</color>. Defeat him, and I will make a pact with you. You will become one of the commanders of the Emerald Empire and gain power commensurate with my generosity.						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_ilhutl_after_spawn	It doesn't matter how many clones you send here. I will drink gavvakh from each one. The warriors of <color=#FFFEC1>Gannix</color> will witness our battle. You will not serve the <color=#FFFEC1>Master</color>!						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_tezctlan_after_first_death	I ordered you to <color=#FFFEC1>defeat</color> Ilhutl. <color=#FFFEC1>Ilhutl is not defeated</color>. Fight until you do it <color=#FFFEC1>truly</color>.<br><br>And to make it more interesting for me to watch, I allow my warriors to fight on Ilhutl's side.						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_ilhutl_rnd1	That is not dead which can eternal lie, fool.						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_ilhutl_rnd2	Do you think Tezctlan sent you to prove your strength? You are merely a sacrifice for <color=#FFFEC1>me</color>.						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_ilhutl_rnd3	People's dreams of power are such fertile soil for the seeds of suffering.						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_ilhutl_rnd4	You cannot defeat me. Your world was ready for my coming. It accepted me as it once accepted my Master.						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_ilhutl_rnd5	I hope, clone, your Boss <color=#FFFEC1>will send me another one</color>.						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_jane_after_first_monolith	I detected a huge energy surge. Analyzing...<br><br>There are <color=#FFFEC1>five</color> of such monoliths in the Feathered Temple. Well, four already. It looks like they are the ones that are <color=#FFFEC1>keeping Ilhutl in the physical world</color>.						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_jane_after_all_monoliths	Sensors are registering a drop in quasimorphic energy. Now we can complete the mission. <color=#FFFEC1>Find and destroy Ilhutl</color>.						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_ilhutl_after_defeat	Impossible. The Master promised…						
ui.dialog.poisontrial_tezctlan_after_defeat	You have proven that you have skill and dignity. I will decide the future of Ilhutl myself.<br><br>The <color=#FFFEC1>Pact</color> of Eternal Service to the <color=#FFFEC1>Emerald Empire</color> has already been sent to your spacecraft. Serve me faithfully, and your eyes will reflect a green glow. Disappoint me, and you will envy the dead.						
ui.dialog.return_ancom_data.RealWare2	What is this? New information about AnCom? This is always interesting. You made the right choice to bring the data to us. There is no better arbiter of the ancap system than RealWare. We will contact you if your services are needed.						
ui.dialog.covertops_realware_after_ancom_quest	Greetings, mercenary! Some time ago, you gave us some very interesting information about <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>. I believe that you chose us for a reason. <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color> is the only corporation that guards the interests of the <color=#FFFEC1>ancap system</color>. We are its true defenders.<br><br>It turns out that AnCom has made great strides in quasimorphic research. According to information from the PCPU, we are not even talking about decades of research there. To delve so deeply into quasimorphosis, one would have to start long before the <color=#FFFEC1>Great Anarchic Revolution</color>. Now I understand why <color=#FFFEC1>Doctor Manning</color> is considered a genius. He had a very good start.<br><br>We gave you the data to hack a PCPU. Perform any <color=#FFFEC1>Espionage mission</color> for AnCom, hack their device, and we'll get into their closed network. Let's find out what AnCom really is.						
ui.dialog.covertops_realware_after_espionage	Good job! The hacked PCPU is transmitting data to us from the closed <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> network. It will take several months to sort out the data. But we already see a direct threat to order in the Solar System. AnCom is trying to hack the algorithm of the <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare Corporation combat AI</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Our</color> combat AI.<br><br>We don’t yet know why and how they want to use it, but we can’t allow it. The AnCom analytical center, which collects information about the AI, is located at the <color=#FFFEC1>Humankinds's Hope Citadel</color> on the <color=#FFFEC1>Pallas</color> asteroid. We offer you a contract: get to the station’s data center and activate the <color=#FFFEC1>EMP-Scorcher</color> there. We've transfered it to your spacecraft. And check how it works at the same time.<br><br>AnCom's property will not be harmed, and if they try to accuse someone of damaging the data, they will have to say what kind of data it was. They will not do that.						
ui.dialog.covertops_jane_on_arrival	The station is very old. Most levels are connected by stairs. Elevators can help you shorten the way to the data center, but rest assured, <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> will take care of the elevator exits first.						
ui.dialog.covertops_ancom_entering_living_stage	This is AnCom speaking. We demand that the clone be recalled immediately, otherwise we will be forced to take <color=#FFFEC1>emergency measures</color>. The demand will not be repeated.						
ui.dialog.covertops_ancom_entering_data_center	Attention station personnel! <color=#FFFEC1>Morphoprotection<color=#FFFEC1> is disabled. Everyone, apply counter-quasimorphic measures.						
ui.dialog.covertops_jane_entering_data_center	Turns out it's not as easy as we thought. You should hurry!						
ui.dialog.covertops_jane_target_room_no_emp	Wait, you don't have the <color=#FFFEC1>EMP-Scorcher</color>! Without it, we can't disable the station's systems. You need to go back and find the device, or the mission will fail.						
ui.dialog.covertops_jane_target_room	Great, you're here. Set up the <color=#FFFEC1>EMP-Scorcher</color> near the computers.						
ui.dialog.covertops_jane_emp_activated	<color=#FFFEC1>EMP-Scorcher</color> was activated. Looks like all the computers on the station are now dead. If AnCom doesn't have backups, we've pretty much knocked them back. Mission accomplished. Get out of there... and your equipment is fried, too, <color=#FFFEC1>map is inaccessible</color>. You'll have to go in blind.						
ui.dialog.raid_sbn_after_ancom_quest	Some time ago, you've handed over an <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom Corporation PCPU</color>, filled to the brim with <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorphic research</color> to us. Studying it helped fill in some gaps in the chain of events that led to the emergence of <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>. Let's not try to keep a poker face. We know what's going on on <color=#FFFEC1>Venus</color> and beyond.<br><br>Believe me, AnCom bears a huge share of the responsibility for what's happening. In fact, they deceived you. That's why we turned to you. We believe that you can be trusted with the mission against AnCom.<br><br>Are you familiar with <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Manning</color>? He had an assistant, <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Gendiosa</color>. We really need to talk to her. After the events at <color=#FFFEC1>Frantseva-7</color> station near Saturn, she is hiding in the <color=#FFFEC1>Schwerin</color> city on <color=#FFFEC1>Geist</color>. We are not sure that our agents will be able to complete the mission, so we ask you to get to Gendiosa, convince the doctor to go with you, and bring her to us.						
ui.dialog.raid_jane_on_arrival	We are here. So far, everything is calm. Find the <color=#FFFEC1>doctor</color> and return without unnecessary adventures.						
ui.dialog.raid_unchainedbelt_entering_sector	Hey, hey, people! Residents of LL Sector! I speak on behalf of the Pirate Union, to whom your wonderful city provides convenient docking. A <color=#FFFEC1>cockroach</color> has just entered your sector. I will send a mark to your PCPUs. For <color=#FFFEC1>its murder</color>, I promise you such a reward that you will definitely not have to think about work for the next year.<br><br>Good hunting!						
ui.dialog.raid_jane_entering_sector	That was said over the station's public address system, did I hear right? Okay, the job is getting tougher. Boss, did you arm the operative properly?						
ui.dialog.raid_doctor_after_meeting	<color=#FFFEC1>Manning</color> warned me that sooner or later you would show up. I've already packed my things, let's go.						
ui.dialog.raid_jane_doctor_dead	Everyone in Schwerin has grabbed their weapons and are moving towards you. This is a <color=#FFFEC1>failure</color>, we are leaving.						
ui.dialog.raid_jane_sbn_arrival	<color=#FFFEC1>Station Security</color> finally noticed that half of the station is going nuts. They sent operatives to LL Sector. Let me check the order now... Yeah, kill everyone indiscriminately, turn the sector into a demilitarized zone. <color=#FFFEC1>Get out</color> of here quickly, don't forget <color=#FFFEC1>the professor</color>.						
ui.dialog.raid_jane_lift_doctor_nearby	You've arrived. I'm unlocking the private dock, the pilot has already turned on the engines.						
ui.dialog.raid_jane_lift_no_doctor	We can't evacuate you <color=#FFFEC1>without the target</color>. Bring her over.						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_unchainedbelt_contact	This is <color=#FFFEC1>Unchained Belt</color> speaking. Accept the transmission...<br><br>I see you've got a knack for ruining relationships with the bigwigs of the corporate world. Ever since that cute little beastie threw a party on Venus, you've done a lot to make the ancap system look at you with suspicion. Yes, we know about Tezctlan. We know it's not a fake. We have eyes in the Inner System, too.<br><br>In short, we need a contractor like you. For certain reasons, we don't want to take direct actions against corporations that have an active interest in the Belt. After all, we all share these rocks together. It's not time to upset the delicate balance yet, but it's a nice thing to tweak a few things. Your target is <color=#FFFEC1>CoreWard MG</color>. You'll attack and capture their <color=#FFFEC1>HIS Woodpecker</color> in orbit around Vesta, and then send it to orbit around Interamnia. Of course, the ship will have to be refueled first. This is not a problem if you provide our guys with access to the engine level.<br><br>For you, a well-paid job, for us - a new valuable asset. And for the Belt - a small increase in tension instead of a full-fledged war. Is there any reason to refuse such a contract?						
	Ici le <color=#FFFEC1>Unchained Belt</color>. Accepte la transmission...<br><br>Je vois que tu as un certain talent pour te brouiller avec les pontes du monde corporatif. Depuis que cette petite bête mignonne a fait la fête sur Vénus, tu as fait beaucoup pour que le système ancap te regarde avec suspicion. Oui, nous savons pour Tezctlan. Nous savons que ce n'est pas un faux. Nous avons aussi des yeux dans le Système Intérieur.<br><br>En résumé, nous avons besoin d'un contractant comme toi. Pour certaines raisons, nous ne voulons pas prendre de mesures directes contre les entreprises qui ont un intérêt actif dans la Ceinture. Après tout, nous partageons tous ces rochers ensemble. Ce n'est pas encore le moment de bouleverser l'équilibre délicat, mais c'est agréable de pouvoir ajuster quelques détails. Ta cible est <color=#FFFEC1>CoreWard MG</color>. Tu attaqueras et captureras leur <color=#FFFEC1>HIS Woodpecker</color> en orbite autour de Vesta, puis tu l'enverras en orbite autour d'Interamnia. Bien sûr, le vaisseau devra être ravitaillé d'abord. Ce n'est pas un problème si tu fournis à nos gars un accès au niveau des moteurs.<br><br>Pour toi, un travail bien payé, pour nous – un nouvel atout précieux. Et pour la Ceinture – une petite augmentation de la tension au lieu d'une guerre totale. Y a-t-il une raison de refuser un tel contrat?						
	Habla el <color=#FFFEC1>Unchained Belt</color>. Acepta la transmisión...<br><br>Veo que tienes una habilidad especial para arruinar relaciones con los grandes magnates del mundo corporativo. Desde que esa pequeña bestia celebró una fiesta en Venus, has hecho mucho para que el sistema ancap te mire con sospecha. Sí, sabemos sobre Tezctlan. Sabemos que no es un engaño. También tenemos ojos en el Sistema Interno.<br><br>En resumen, necesitamos a un contratista como tú. Por ciertas razones, no queremos tomar medidas directas contra las corporaciones que tienen un interés activo en el Cinturón. Después de todo, todos compartimos estos asteroides. No es el momento de alterar el delicado equilibrio aún, pero sería bueno ajustar algunas cosas. Tu objetivo es <color=#FFFEC1>CoreWard MG</color>. Atacarás y capturarás su <color=#FFFEC1>HIS Woodpecker</color> en órbita alrededor de Vesta, y luego lo enviarás a órbita alrededor de Interamnia. Por supuesto, la nave tendrá que ser repostada primero. Esto no es un problema si proporcionas acceso a nuestros chicos al nivel del motor.<br><br>Para ti, un trabajo bien remunerado; para nosotros, un nuevo activo valioso. Y para el Cinturón, un pequeño aumento de la tensión en lugar de una guerra a gran escala. ¿Hay alguna razón para rechazar tal contrato?						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_jane_on_arrival	A truck from the <color=#FFFEC1>Dilthey</color> corporation is moving nearby at a relatively low speed. I don't know what they want, but if they detect a fuel shuttle, they can transmit this information to the <color=#FFFEC1>HIS Woodpecker</color>. Dilthey are some good Samaritans.						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_jane_cc_no_objectives	You can mop up the entire spacecraft, but the bird <color=#FFFEC1>won't fly</color> while the quantum fuel tanks are <color=#FFFEC1>empty</color> and the armory's security system is <color=#FFFEC1>working</color>. First, clear out these floors.						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_jane_cc_start_defence	Eliminate anyone who might prevent us from taking control of the spacecraft. After that, we'll take the bird to its new nest.						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_jane_cc_cleared	There is nothing else stopping us. Head to <color=#FFFEC1>Interamnia</color>.						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_jane_arsenal_entering	You need to disable the <color=#FFFEC1>security system</color> in the armory. The <color=#FFFEC1>CoreWard MG</color> security team has blocked the spacecraft's control system. Find the mainframe and deal with it... as best you can.

The boss asked me to thank you for your part in the <color=#FFFEC1>Unchained Belt</color> case if you make it this far. We've got a few guys here who are eager to fight. We'll drop them on your floor.						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_jane_fuel_room	Protect the engines while the refueling is going.						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_jane_fuel_room_before_arsenal	First you need to destroy the <color=#FFFEC1>mainframe in the Arsenal</color>.						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_coreward_dilthey_arrived	Attention! The sale of HIS Woodpecker to <color=#FFFEC1>Dilthey Corporation</color> has been completed. CoreWard MG disclaims liability for the asset.						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_dilthey_dilthey_arrived	Attention! We ask all unauthorized personnel to leave HIS Woodpecker, it is the private property of the <color=#FFFEC1>Dilthey</color> Corporation. The corporation's <color=#FFFEC1>security officers</color> will be transported here from the nearby cargo spacecraft Nikolaus Otto to ensure the asset's safety.						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_unchainedbelt_dilthey_arrived	We don't care how you planned to build relations with <color=#FFFEC1>Dilthey</color>. The contract must be fulfilled in any case. There is not much time left until the end of the refueling.						
ui.dialog.ghoulship_jane_fuel_is_complete	The pirate tanker has undocked. Make your way to the command floor. Remember that <color=#FFFEC1>Dilthey</color> truck that flew past? It dropped off a whole bunch of <color=#FFFEC1>armed combatants</color>. Good luck.

terminal.tutorial0.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Recruit</color>, welcome to <color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color>! This station was the tool of thieving vampires, sucking the juices from the free people of the <color=#FFFEC1>Solar System</color>. It is now turned to the benefit of the working people. You made the right choice when you decided to leave your employer and then get to the nearest <color=#FFFEC1>Civilian Resistance</color> base by any means necessary. No more corporate slavery! You are to go through reintegration into organized society. Soon you will become a <color=#FFFEC1>citizen</color> again. Right now you need to go to the training class, where you will gradually start to learn what it means to become a full member of the <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color>. I welcome you and thank you for making the right choice. <color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>.						
terminal.tutorial1.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>, you should start showing results in the <color=#FFFEC1>Internal System</color> as soon as possible. You are conducting open combat operations, sacrificing many of our <color=#FFFEC1>colnodes</color> that could be useful to us at <color=#FFFEC1>Saturn</color> or in our business at transneptunian sites. You promised to strike a sensitive blow to <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color> and reveal the truth about <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>. But you did not strike <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color>, and your theory about <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> may be incorrect. You must conduct an immediate review of the rational use of resources in your sector. <color=#FFFEC1>Lia</color>.						
terminal.tutorial2.desc	"<color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color> is secure enough to prepare messages for routing into the <color=#FFFEC1>External System</color>. I have successfully infiltrated <color=#FFFEC1>L-BSA</color> as a security guard. Some time ago, there was an attack here by <color=#FFFEC1>HIS ""Magnum""</color> to extract some important prisoner. I managed to establish that <color=#FFFEC1>HIS</color> acted as contractors for <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>. The chances that my theory is correct have sharply increased. <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> is more than just a publisher. Unfortunately, <color=#FFFEC1>L-BSA</color> is now open to attack, and its owners will change. I'm not sure if I can continue to provide relevant information. <color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>."						
terminal.tutorial3.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>, your demand for more <color=#FFFEC1>Colnodes</color> is outrageous. You work within the <color=#FFFEC1>Internal System</color>. You have <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color> at your disposal! You need to manage with available resources and focus on recruitment. <color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>, your recent behavior is causing concern. Perhaps too many <color=#FFFEC1>Colnodes</color> can lead to disintegration of <color=#FFFEC1>personality</color>. We will conduct the appropriate research. Remember that the social must always prevail over the personal. <color=#FFFEC1>Lia</color>.						
terminal.tutorial4.desc	The number of counter-intelligence agents in the streets of RealWare<color=#FFFEC1>InterCity</color> is extremely high, my <color=#FFFEC1>colnodes</color> are constantly at risk of being exposed. From now on, I'm going to keep one bullet in <color=#FFFEC1>Liberator</color> for myself. The risk of our secrets falling into the hands of <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color> is not justified. Especially since this is not our priority target in the <color=#FFFEC1>Internal System</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>.						
terminal.communityMission1.desc	Station Zero, <color=#FFFEC1>Manning</color> analysis. From this point it is worth starting a report of a systematic study of quasimorphosis. The important part: “No pathogens were isolated from the group. No bacteria, viruses, fungi, or higher parasites. <color=#FFFEC1>I know for sure</color> that hormonal imbalances are a consequence of their madness and not the cause. None of those interrogated could describe the reasons why they decided to join the cult. Even the organizers say that this idea just came to them. Some patients report whispers from another world. The phenomenon has no physical cause. But there is a physical effect. I propose to call this phenomenon quasimorphosis.” Learn by heart.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.						
terminal.communityMission2.desc	Why don't we find alive beings in <color=#FFFEC1>phased buildings</color>? Expedition Sector Louhi-XV: Dr. Peabody has confirmed that Object 0-177C is a sarcophagus. Very similar to a Nahua sarcophagus. Moreover, Peabody insisted that it was sealed as if the funeral rites had already been completed. But the sarcophagus is empty. Where should we look for quasimorphs?<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.						
terminal.communityMission3.desc	"<color=#FFFEC1>Eccollapse</color>. It is the answer to my question. Hypothesis: <color=#FFFEC1>phasing</color> - transition of inanimate objects from pleroma to kenoma; eccollapse - the transition of living objects from <color=#FFFEC1>pleroma</color> to <color=#FFFEC1>kenoma</color>. Does this mean that quasimorphs are in some sense ""living objects""?<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.<br><br>Project Dislocator Note: If my theory of movement into the pleroma is correct, can I return Tifton combatants back without eccolapse? It will be funny to watch how the mercenaries get back into the kenoma through the bodies of people.<br><br>Additional: talk to the authorities about buying prisoners in <color=#FFFEC1>L-BSA</color>."						
terminal.communityMission4.desc	"Does the existence of phased sarcophagi means that quasimorphs ""die"" in their <color=#FFFEC1>bramfaturas</color>? Maybe my hypothesis was wrong from the very beginning. It is necessary to immediately request from Peabody an array of hypotheses about the possible purpose of objects of type 0-177C other than funeral ones.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>."						
terminal.communityMission5.desc	The deciphering of stone R-98-21 is progressing. The <color=#FFFEC1>Knorozov</color> tables still fit after transposition. An analytical analysis of the result is next. From what catches the eye, <color=#FFFEC1>the Silver Orb</color> is mentioned there. Сosmography of its location relative to Venus shows that it may be Earth.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.						
terminal.communityMission6.desc	The report was sent to Fresco's board of directors. Now they will definitely finance my project on Mercury. However, I can't wait to see what the corporate intelligence officers bring back from Earth. I hope <color=#FFFEC1>Interdict</color> will not interfere, and the cargo will arrive on time.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.						
terminal.communityMission7.desc	I hope the archive ends up in good hands. I am removing the security levels available to me from <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz's</color> personal journal. These... Beings... They are already appearing on the streets of Oddibjord-3. Better death than going through what happened to the guys... The last thing I can do is make the texts of this monster public. The communication channel with <color=#FFFEC1>SBN</color> is not working. The texts will be in the terminals, I hope sooner or later the one who will save humanity will get to them.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Archivist, Randall Baranov, Star-4 access</color>.						
terminal.communityMission8.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Quasimorphs</color> are not even energy, they are a completely new type of existence. I believe that by moving to Earth they must have either acquired a body without eccolapse or somehow become attached to a material object. My research on the <color=#FFFEC1>Dislocator</color> will already allow me to create a prototype of a quasimorphic detector. I think I won’t be mistaken if I propose to the management to send a reconnaissance group to Mexico City or another altepetl.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.						
terminal.dislocatorMission1.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>, I express my gratitude for your help in <color=#FFFEC1>The Internal System</color>. You carried out Operation Gilead brilliantly. Please, maintain control of <color=#FFFEC1>Flat Obsidian</color> for at least a little while longer. Sending data about <color=#FFFEC1>the Device</color> over the Network is prohibited. Send a courier. <color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color>						
terminal.dislocatorMission2.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color>, how can you say that HIS of <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> corporation is not monitoring Venus for the purpose of reselling information, but is somehow exercising control over the Invasion ? Your theory from here, from the core of the System, looks even less reliable than from the rings of Saturn. <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>						
terminal.dislocatorMission3.desc	The courier has arrived in <color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color>. I'm working with data. I ask you to assist me on Mercury for at least some more time. I look forward to your cooperation, <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color>						
terminal.dislocatorMission4.desc	Leave Mercury immediately and return to <color=#FFFEC1>Saturn</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color> has no authority to give you orders, <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>. We are aware of <color=#FFFEC1>the Device</color>. Immediately deconstruct it and take with you all the components that you consider significant for analysis. <color=#FFFEC1>Lia</color>						
terminal.dislocatorMission5.desc	I've intercepted the message from <color=#FFFEC1>the Council</color>. Don't ask questions. <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>, I ask you to trust me. We will be able to use the <color=#FFFEC1>Dislocator</color> to fight the Regime. Stay on <color=#FFFEC1>Mercury</color>, I'll think of something soon. <color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color>						
terminal.dislocatorMission6.desc	Say <color=#FFFEC1>the Emerald Word</color> and you will live forever under the banner of the green shine. If you refuse I will send my slaves to you to extinguish your sick consciousness forever. <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>						
terminal.dislocatorMission7.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color>, you should make a decision as soon as possible. Quasimorphic distortions occur in the communication systems. In addition there are signs of bearing <color=#FFFEC1>Flat Obsidian</color> from HIS without a corporate transponder. <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>						
terminal.dislocatorMission8.desc	If you do not immediately leave <color=#FFFEC1>Mercury</color> then <color=#FFFEC1>the Council</color> will raise the question of declaring you and <color=#FFFEC1>comrade Issachar</color> renegades. Your help is objectively needed on <color=#FFFEC1>Saturn</color>. Stop testing the patience of <color=#FFFEC1>the Council</color>, <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Lia</color>						
terminal.communityStone1.desc	To the new king who received the kingdom from <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>. The Orders transfer power to you until Tezctlan returns from the pilgrimage to <color=#FFFEC1>the Silver Orb</color>. You are bound by the oaths of Jaguar, Eagle, Python, and the rest of the free inhabitants of Gannix. We wait and believe that the hylonaut (traveller to earth - footnote by <color=#FFFEC1>Eipschwitz</color>) will return and again take the Emerald Kingdom into his hands.<br><br>Before the Reaper of the Harvest, I answer to the Orders, <color=#FFFEC1>Marquis Decarabia</color>, renounce the honor of waiting for Tezctlan on the obsidian throne. May Gannix live for an eon without a king. Free orders under the glow of the red-golden eye of <color=#FFFEC1>Gagtungr</color>.<br><br>No one has ever returned from <color=#FFFEC1>the Silver Orb</color>. We don't know how Tezctlan will be regained.						
terminal.dragonReborn1.desc	Report date 993008. The inability to take a sample from <color=#FFFEC1>the Monolith</color> forces us to work with it holistically. We are now testing the assumption that this is a <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorph</color>. Second hypothesis: the existence of a quasimorph on <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color> means that there is still a <color=#FFFEC1>bramfatura</color> here, but it is much more hidden than the others. On the other hand, if all the quasimorphs of this bramfatura are as inert as the Monolith, then there may already be many of them around us, but we mistake them for the natural structures of Mars. <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>						
terminal.dragonReborn2.desc	Report date 991009. No radiography of <color=#FFFEC1>the Monolith</color> gives clear results. At this point, one thing can be said: the Monolith does not come from our world. Perhaps it was brought here from another planet after <color=#FFFEC1>phasing</color> there. Or <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color> has a hidden <color=#FFFEC1>bramfatura</color>. Third hypothesis: Mars <color=#FFFEC1>had</color> bramfatura and the Monolith phased before it disappeared. Corollary: bramfaturas may disappear. Hypothesis to be tested: whether bramfaturas can occur. <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>						
terminal.dragonReborn3.desc	Report date 992109. A report for the management has been generated and submitted. There is no way to study <color=#FFFEC1>the Monolith</color> more than we already have. Perhaps it will remain a mystery to <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color> for decades to come. <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>						
terminal.dragonReborn4.desc	Report date 991111. The device that was given to us allows us to gain a much deeper understanding of the nature of the Monolith. I'd like to know which corporation is so far advanced in quasimorphic research. RealWare has nothing like it. The data is already being brought together. <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>						
terminal.dragonReborn5.desc	Report date 991113. My hypothesis was correct. <color=#FFFEC1>The Monolith</color> is a <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorph</color>. At least all the key metrics match the data that was provided to our team with the device. However, I have to decipher <color=#FFFEC1>what state</color> this quasimorph is in. What do these shifts to the left along the Q-spectrum mean? <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>						
terminal.dragonReborn6.desc	Report date 991225. Usually at Christmas people give gifts, but they were taken away from us. Yesterday we handed over the device to security. Now all we have to do is process the data. Hypothesis four: can <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorphs</color> sleep. Hypothesis five: can quasimorphs <color=#FFFEC1>be dead</color> in a way that leave bodies. Perhaps the Monolith is a dead quasimorph. <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>

faction.AnCom.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Hexarch AnCom</color> describes itself as a publishing business group. It is the largest producer of media content in the <color=#FFFEC1>System</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> employs a huge staff of writers, screenwriters, film producers, video game developers, and so on. All this makes AnCom one of the most <color=#FFFEC1>influential</color> companies in the System. Through entertainment content, AnCom promotes the values ​​of <color=#FFFEC1>anarcho-capitalism</color>. It may not be the richest hexarch, but AnCom's commitment to the values ​​of the <color=#FFFEC1>ancap system</color> is beyond doubt.<br><br>It is well-known that AnCom has a <color=#FFFEC1>considerable research division</color>. It is unclear to many in the System what exactly these well-hidden research teams are doing. Due to our close work with AnCom in the past, we know that these studies focus on <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorphosis</color>.<br><br>No one can trace the <color=#FFFEC1>history of AnCom</color> exactly. It seems that the corporation simply appeared out of nowhere shortly before the <color=#FFFEC1>Great Anarchist Revolution</color>. However, there is information about the media conglomerate Eurasian Literary Society (ELS). It was this that became the basis of AnCom. ELS was the property of a major Eurasian businessman. According to rumors, a follower of ancient esoteric teachings. At some point, ELS shareholders removed the owner from managing the company, and it became rich from the production and sale of entertainment content. Then ELS began buying up the last independent studios and publishing houses, after which it transformed into AnCom. AnCom Corporation took an active part in the Revolution, sponsoring the formation of <color=#FFFEC1>private armies</color> and wiping away mercenaries' loyalty from national states by higher price.<br><br>Evil tongues call AnCom the Ministry of Propaganda of the ancap system. This is not far from the truth. All hexarchs can afford any field of activity. They are all engaged in production, and supplies, and energy production, and scientific activity. However, each hexarch invests most heavily in some unique profile, where it is simply impossible to compete with them. AnCom's focus is entertainment. However, their films, books, and video games are literally stuffed with anarcho-capitalist propaganda. There is range of action movies, where the hero shoots hordes of the <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> colnodes or historical strategy games about the days of the Great Anarchist Revolution. That's what AnCom creates for recreation.<br><br>Recently, the corporation has been creating content in which the protagonist destroys hordes of monsters and hosts of demons. Screen adaptations of Robert E. Howard's books about Conan the Barbarian, who saves humanity from monsters, are a popular endless series from AnCom. Also there is highly demanded a series of games about the conquistadors of Cortes, conquering the nightmarish and disgusting civilizations of Mesoamerica.

faction.Tezctlan.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color> and <color=#FFFEC1>his quasimorphs</color> have learned how to remain in the physical world indefinitely. Tezctlan has proclaimed himself <color=#FFFEC1>Emerald Emperor</color>, and <color=#FFFEC1>the Solar System</color> as his future Emerald Empire. Tezctlan seeks to subjugate all of humanity, as well as other bramfaturas. At the end of 2199, he was able to access the SBN network and announce his intentions through open channels. The Hexarchy is doing its utmost to maintain the narrative that this was nothing more than an act of <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color>. We know that Tezctlan's abilities and his sudden uprise are linked to <color=#FFFEC1>Fresco corporation</color> technology.<br><br>We have completed several missions for <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> against Fresco earlier. It was our actions that led to the emergence or awakening (see below) of Tezctlan. However, we share this responsibility with Doctor <color=#FFFEC1>Eipschwitz</color>.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>The history of Tezctlan</color> is difficult to analyze precisely. This quasimorph either appeared or reborn on Venus in late 2199. As far as we can tell, the reborn option is closer to the truth. Tezctlan was the highest hierarch of Gannix, but then either disappeared from the bramfatura or was plunged into a sleep-like state. This happened hundreds to thousands of years ago. Fresco Corporation, a virtual monopoly on the surface of Venus, was attacked by other <color=#FFFEC1>system corporations</color>. Such a brazen raider takeover is possible only with the tacit approval of the <color=#FFFEC1>Hexarchy</color>. In a desperate attempt to save the corporation, its management allowed Dr. Eipschwitz, a radical scientist, to use <color=#FFFEC1>any necessary means</color>. The awakening of Tezctlan did not help Fresco survive, but those who tried to appropriate their property on Venus suffered serious losses.<br><br>Tezctlan declared his kingdom of Gannix an Empire. And he proclaimed that the new <color=#FFFEC1>Emerald Empire</color> is an empire of two realms. Now he wants only one thing: to subjugate humanity. Apparently, Tezctlan needs us not only as servants or slaves, but also as a constant source of <color=#FFFEC1>gavvakh</color> the source of energy.

At the lower level, SBN is divided into numerous news <color=#FFFEC1>agencies</color>. Each SBN station forms a separate agency, whose staff of journalists and editors immediately begins to produce news about the station, the celestial body, and all nearby routes. In addition, the SBN has <color=#FFFEC1>technical units</color> that support the network infrastructure. It is no secret that these units consist of highly qualified intelligence officers and decoding specialists. They intercept and analyze all traffic passing through the SBN stations.<br><br>In addition, it is necessary to note <color=#FFFEC1>The System Portal SBN</color>. A continuous flow of raw information that the SBN transmits from the AES (<color=#FFFEC1>Earth</color>). This is an open channel where all legal (not being the <color=#FFFEC1>public enemy</color>) participants of the ancap system get and place of types of messages. This is how an endless information and news feed is formed. Everyone simply calls this Portal the SBN. At the same time, cyphered data can be transmitted through it. How and what to fish out of the SBN is up to the recipient. Workers in the martian mines with outdated PCPUs can only count on an edited official news feed. Rich stations with serious analytical departments can intercept encrypted contracts for PMCs or mysterious relic transmissions on behalf of the long-destroyed <color=#FFFEC1>Hive</color> corporation. It became a sensation when, at the end of 2199, a strange message was transmitted through the SBN. The sender of this message was a <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorph</color>, who introduced himself to the entire System as <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>.<br><br>All agencies, as well as technical departments, are closed on the <color=#FFFEC1>Board of Directors</color> of SBN. Strategic decisions are made at the board with the <color=#FFFEC1>Chairman</color> at the helm. The operational management of the corporation is carried out by the <color=#FFFEC1>chief executive officer</color>. The Board of Directors subjects of the latter's work to strict and constant audit. But it was not always so.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>The history of SBN</color> begins where the history of the major media conglomerates of the Earth ends. SBN emerged shortly before the <color=#FFFEC1>Great Anarchist Revolution</color>, when the heirs of the great visionary of the past, who already owned 75% of all media resources of humanity, bought up the remaining 25%. SBN took on the burden of coordinating the actions of the revolutionary armies, monitoring the actions of corporations during the GAR, and so on. It was SBN that provided the platform for posting the current version of the <color=#FFFEC1>New Corporate Ethics</color>, the de facto constitution of the ancap system.<br><br>For thirty long years, the executive director was <color=#FFFEC1>Maria Ancel</color>. She was an enthusiast of the news business and the philosophy of information. She reformed the management of SBN so that the board of directors were subordinate to the executive director. Mrs. Ancel and a small circle of her close associates had access to information, according to which they directed the activities of SBN. As a result, by the last third of the 22nd century, SBN became, in fact, <color=#FFFEC1>the ministry of information of the Hexarchy</color>. Of course, SBN rejects such an offensive label.<br><br>Nine years ago, Maria Ancel was killed in a terrorist attack on SBN. The Board immediately reversed her reforms to the CEO position, and Ancel's place was taken by the docile but highly effective <color=#FFFEC1>Ally Pally</color>. Nevertheless, the influence of Ancel's legacy is enormous. Monuments to her are erected at SBN stations, and the corporation's management holds peculiar rituals on the day of her death. The true heir to Ancel's ideas is considered to be the current chairman of the board <color=#FFFEC1>Roberto Millner</color>.<br><br>The policy of SBN consists of a declared strict subordination to the <color=#FFFEC1>NCE</color>. It is believed that SBN achieves its goals through cunning manipulation of PMCs and other hexarchs. Even SBN security service is extremely small. In his New Year's (2200) address to the ancap system, Millner called SBN ""the herald of a new era of humanity, taking upon itself the heavy burden of bringing the light of truth."""

Although it was the failed policies of corrupt governments that led to the dissolution of UN-2, the one who struck the first blow, which caused the conflict to enter the hot phase, will always remain in memory. RealWare dropped thermonuclear charges on Geneva. The HIS Day of Fire, which carried out the attack, now is in orbital parking near Pluto: an eternal reminder of how the liberation of humanity began.<br><br>RealWare continues its policy of protecting the <color=#FFFEC1>ancap system</color> from any destabilization. The corporation does not engage in propaganda like AnCom and SBN, but in practice proves that the free market is the key to a fair society. The corporation also openly states that <color=#FFFEC1>its own values</color> are based on contempt for the purely reputational and investment sector of the market. RealWare states that it is ready to send employees to their deaths in the name of protecting the ability of others to do what they want, and thereby work for the benefit of humanity.<br><br>Of course, all these declarations do not prevent RealWare from investing in the most profitable sectors of the economy. However, RealWare's real strength is the production of spacecrafts, weapons, and defense systems.<br><br>RealWare has a strict discipline and a complex system of internal regulations. The corporation tries to imitate the image of the ancient Roman Empire, which is why it is often called the Empire. RealWare itself rejects any attempts to compare itself to a national state and considers it propaganda of the Civil Resistance. This is easy to believe, since the Empire's warehouses overflowing with weapons are the number one target for the rebels.<br><br>The corporation is managed by a <color=#FFFEC1>Board of Trustees</color> headed by a <color=#FFFEC1>Precentor</color>. For twenty years now, the position of Precentor has been held by <color=#FFFEC1>Ian Fraser</color>. A role model for everyone in the System, a man who has realized the Solar Dream. He started as a janitor at one of the RealWare stations, passed an internal interview for the position of security guard, and then moved up the ranks until he reached the very top. The head of all armed employees of the corporation is the <color=#FFFEC1>Security Legatus</color>. The position is currently held by Fraser's recently appointed bruiser <color=#FFFEC1>Angus Dungeon</color>. Rumor has it that the previous Security Legatus died on Venus while leading a force in one of <color=#FFFEC1>deniable operations</color> against another corporation. Since the Security Legatus has operational control over the real military force, RealWare has a well-known dual power: <color=#FFFEC1>duumvirate</color>.<br><br>All <color=#FFFEC1>nuclear weapons</color> of states were transferred by the Hexarchy to RealWare for safekeeping. It is believed that only they are capable of ensuring their safekeeping. The norms of the <color=#FFFEC1>New Corporate Ethics</color> enshrine this position, as well as the responsibility that RealWare bears for such trust from all participants of the ancap system.<br><br>RealWare begins its <color=#FFFEC1>history</color> in the chaos of the wars of the mid-21st century. The arms companies, supplying their products to all sides of the conflict at once, found it increasingly difficult to ensure extraterritoriality. So they hired several private armies to protect their property. From the very beginning of this cooperation, the army leadership pursued a policy of entryism in the management of corporations. As a result, one of the armies forced several corporations to unite under a new name. Of course, this led to several internal armed conflicts. Truly, the RealWare corporation was tempered in fire.

Products balancing on the edge medicines and psychoactive drugs are supplied by Daydream Chems, which ensures the anonymity of the buyer. It is very likely that a significant part of corporations that need to enhance the capabilities of their employees (from <color=#FFFEC1>CoreWard MG</color> to <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color>) are supplied by Daydream Chems.<br><br>The <color=#FFFEC1>history</color> of Daydream Chems begins as an anarcho-capitalist dream. A group of independent pharmacists decided to create unique substances to alter the perception of reality. After the <color=#FFFEC1>Great Anarchist Revolution</color>, they were no longer held back by regulatory laws and imaginary restrictions. Over time, their success led to integration with larger pharmaceutical concerns, where these chemists immediately took key positions.

On the other hand, the Coven competes with <color=#FFFEC1>Daydream Chems</color> in pharmaceutical research. They also compete with <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> because they own a small media empire. Based on the traditions of 20th and 21st century cults, reinforced by modern psychoactive technologies, the Coven offers its followers not just a religious experience, but “true enlightenment.” All employees of the corporation are required to participate in religious and ecstatic practices, since it is believed that enlightened people are much more effective than ordinary people.<br><br>The pharmaceutical arm of the Coven is a vital element in ensuring the commercial stability of the religious corporation.

Colnodes are known for their astounding combat effectiveness and ruthlessness. There is a theory that they do not feel pain, fear, or other human emotions, recognizing these states only as indicators: damage, danger, and so on. It is believed that these changes allow them to fight to the last, without fear of death. It is possible that this is not due to psychotechnics and medicine.

Having grown out of the ruins of the old order in the midst of the <color=#FFFEC1>Great Anarchist Revolution</color>, the corporation does not directly come from any major conglomerate. At the beginning of its journey, several medical corporations teamed up with an ambitious engineering concern to jointly research human adaptation to life in space. The medical part of the corporation focused on psychology and psychiatry, conducting numerous studies on how the human psyche reacts to the new extreme conditions of the space environment. The results of this research allowed the Dilthey engineering branch to develop space stations and residential complexes taking into account the psychological and physiological needs of humans.<br><br>During the fierce conflicts on <color=#FFFEC1>Earth</color> and <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color>, Dilthey did not engage in direct combat, focusing instead on reclaiming the <color=#FFFEC1>Main Belt</color> and some of the Outer System's moons. Despite this, Dilthey's propaganda claims that they played a decisive role in securing the GAR's victory in these regions, defending them from loyalist and civilian armies.

mission.SecondTutorial.name	Taste of revenge						
mission.SecondTutorial.briefing	Keep in mind that we're not getting paid for this. Taking a contract would have been a better idea. <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> has set up a field camp in <color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color>. Training complexes, as well as some kind of medical facilities or laboratories. It's unclear. Sometimes messages flash in the <color=#FFFEC1>SBN</color> that terrorists are accumulating rare and valuable items. Weapons and equipment for their 'liberation struggle'. Maybe we can justify the time spent here if we're lucky. So let's get even, but let's do it with benefit. Get to their anti-space defense complex and destroy it. After that, the pilots will direct <color=#FFFEC1>‘Magnum’</color> to the cargo dock in <color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color> and we will start loading everything that's lying there.						
mission.SecondTutorial.desc	The Rogue City Station's autonomous missile defense server must be destroyed.

mission.SecondTutorial.after	We not only took all the valuables, but also patched up the holes from the boarding shuttles. In <color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color> we had everything we needed for that. Boss, we also found a <color=#FFFEC1>PCPU with a database</color> belonging to the <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> corporation. There is a lot of information about <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorphosis</color> research. They are willing to generously compensate for our expenses in return for such valuable intellectual property. But of course, we made a copy of all the data from their device. Their agent is ready to meet us in <color=#FFFEC1>Rebus Sky City</color> in orbit of <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color>.

We need to connect the <color=#FFFEC1>Red Chip</color> and infect the global communication system with a generative virus that will destroy it.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Additional information:</color> Issachar, the CR coordinator in the Inner System, told us about the <color=#FFFEC1>Red Chip</color> - a device with which the rebels are going to disable communication channels throughout the Solar System. All we need is a powerful server to which most of the Network nodes are connected. Such a server exists and is located in orbit around <color=#FFFEC1>Earth</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Agent Justas</color> will be waiting for us at the site to hand over the <color=#FFFEC1>Red Chip</color>.<br><br>Near-Earth orbit is a <color=#FFFEC1>demilitarized zone</color>. Corporations do not wage war there by agreement. The CR and pirates do not do so, as they fear brutal vengeance. An attack on the <color=#FFFEC1>Heritage</color> Communications Station could upset the fragile balance in the System. Our actions will kindle a flame that will be difficult to extinguish. We will help the cause of liberation of the working people, and there will be more work for us.<br><br>We need to take the <color=#FFFEC1>Red Chip</color> from the agent at the station, then seize the main communications computer and upload the received virus to it.						
mission.Manifesto.briefing	<color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color> didn't lie. The <color=#FFFEC1>transponders</color> installed on the shuttle worked. The station took us for their own. <color=#FFFEC1>Heritage</color> operates in semi-automatic mode. Easy job! Find a contact in the docks, take the virus from him, and upload it to the server on the <color=#FFFEC1>lower</color> floor of the station.

Tezctlan is ready to make a special <color=#FFFEC1>pact</color> with a mortal who can defeat Ilhutl.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Additional information:</color> <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color> is trying to gain a foothold in two worlds at once. After visiting Earth, he felt cramped in the <color=#FFFEC1>bramfatura of Venus</color>, limited by the laws of the quasimorphic world.

He is ready to make a unique contract with us, according to which you, <color=#FFFEC1>Boss</color>, will become one of the hierarchs of the Emerald Empire.<br><br>However, the Master needs proof. And not of loyalty, but of strength. We must defeat <color=#FFFEC1>Ilhutl</color>, the Poison Knight, champion of the Gannix guard.						
mission.PoisonTrial.briefing	Killing a single quasimorph? Sounds easy. Good luck, though.						
mission.PoisonTrial.objective0	<color=#FFFEC1>Ilhutl</color> must be defeated. Tezctlan ordered it.						
mission.PoisonTrial.objective1	Ilhutl is defeated. This time for good.

mission.CovertOps.name	Covert Operations Guide						
mission.CovertOps.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Task:</color> Activate the <color=#FFFEC1>EMP-Scorcher</color> in the station's data center.						
mission.CovertOps.details	<color=#FFFEC1>Details:</color> <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> is planning operations using the <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare combat AI</color>. This asset is not for sale, so RealWare suspects AnCom of theft. <color=#FFFEC1>Our task</color>: destroy all AnCom data on the combat AI.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Additional Information:</color> <color=#FFFEC1>Humankinds's Hope Citadel</color> was the headquarters of the <color=#FFFEC1>Hive Corporation</color>. It could well have claimed the role of <color=#FFFEC1>hexarch</color>, but it ceased to exist in the mid-22nd century. It is not surprising that AnCom decided to organize field research here. On the one hand, <color=#FFFEC1>Citadel</color> is considered a fairly useless asset, on the other hand, the station is <color=#FFFEC1>well protected</color>.<br><br>The latter means that there is <color=#FFFEC1>no single-shaft elevators</color>. Most likely, you will have to deal with a confusing system of <color=#FFFEC1>stairs</color> and long galleries, in which AnCom will have time to organize a defense.						
mission.CovertOps.briefing	You won't believe it, but the mission may be easier than we thought. The geoscanner detected an <color=#FFFEC1>unusual field</color> around the station. AnCom installed morphoprotectors, so the Citadel should not have <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorphosis</color>. Get into the data center, activate the <color=#FFFEC1>EMP-Scorcher</color>, and we'll be ready to pick you up.						
mission.CovertOps.objective0	You need to get to the <color=#FFFEC1>station data center</color> and activate the <color=#FFFEC1>EMP-Scorcher</color>.

She must be brought to Magnum and handed over to SBN.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Additional information:</color> <color=#FFFEC1>Schwerin</color> is a port that is extremely poorly controlled by its owners. The asset brings in income from rent and docking fees. Trying to organize at least a semblance of order here with the help of your own security service is economically unprofitable. A convenient place to disappear.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Gendiosa</color> is hiding in one of the residential blocks, waiting for something to happen. The report from the SBN agents does not indicate that she has met anyone.<br><br>We hope that it will be a simple walk from the port to the residential complex and back, but this time accompanied by <color=#FFFEC1>Gendiosa</color>. SBN will pick her up immediately after she gets to Magnum.						
mission.Raid.briefing	It's nice to work with the rich and famous. <color=#FFFEC1>SBN</color> has reserved a private dock for us. It will have access to the central elevator system. <color=#FFFEC1>Schwerin</color> is heavy layered, but we will send you straight to the <color=#FFFEC1>Gendiosa floor</color>, LL Sector. Not a nice area, but not a slum either. <color=#FFFEC1>Find her</color> and return to the dock.						
mission.Raid.objective0	Take Dr. <color=#FFFEC1>Gendiosa</color> to the dock where our shuttle is waiting.						
mission.Raid.objective1	Important witness for <color=#FFFEC1>SBN</color> successfully delivered. We can add it to our resume.

mission.Raid.after	<color=#FFFEC1>SBN took Dr. Gendiosa</color>. They treated her very well, I am surprised. It seems that she is a really valuable witness. In addition to the usual reward, the SBN operative reported that the ambush was organized by <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Manning</color>. This was his way of protecting his lab assistant.						
mission.GhoulShip.name	Ship of Ghouls

We must steal for them the <color=#FFFEC1>HIS Woodpecker</color>, which <color=#FFFEC1>CoreWard MG</color> uses as a base of operations in the Main Belt. But first it has to be refueled, and the agents of the Unchained Belt will help us with this.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Additional information:</color> The <color=#FFFEC1>HIS Woodpecker</color> in orbit around <color=#FFFEC1>Vesta</color> has long been used by <color=#FFFEC1>CoreWard MG</color> as a stationary checkpoint in the Main Belt. The pirates have found out that its <color=#FFFEC1>cubecentric engines</color> are fully functional. If the spacecraft is filled with G-3 quantum fuel, it will easily leave orbit.						
mission.GhoulShip.briefing	The shuttle has been detected, so prepare for a fierce defense against the <color=#FFFEC1>CoreWard MG</color> security. In addition, we have <color=#FFFEC1>a new problem</color>: a security system has been installed at the armory level. A signal has been sent from there to block the spacecraft's controls. You will have to get there and <color=#FFFEC1>disable the block</color>. The pirate tanker is already nearby.<br><br>						
mission.GhoulShip.objective0	We need to shut down the arsenal, refuel the <color=#FFFEC1>HIS Woodpecker</color>, and fly it to Interamnia.

The SBN is thick with their protest notes, and the Unchained Belt reports that they just picked up a spacecraft abandoned by a vile <color=#FFFEC1>PMC</color>.

The goal is to find and evacuate the device that the guys from <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> want to get. The colony is destroyed as a result of continuous fighting on the surface of Venus since the appearance of Tezctlan. Now the quasimorphs loyal to him have captured the geodesic and will protect it no matter who appears there.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Additional Info:</color> <color=#FFFEC1>Hexarchy</color>, the information union of six major corporations, has increased <color=#FFFEC1>censorship</color>. Of course, they deny the very existence of censorship. This vocabulary is something from the distant state past. However, it is easy to censor and deny anything when you control the largest routers in the <color=#FFFEC1>System</color>. The actions of the hexarchs are associated with the appearance of Tezctlan on Venus. It will be easier for hard workers and middle managers to work if they do not know about the <color=#FFFEC1>monsters</color> that prowl around them. Because of our active participation in events we know something. The former assets of the destroyed concern <color=#FFFEC1>Fresco</color> on Venus became a battlefield between various forces and factions. The intensity of quasimorphic events on Venus is extremely high. Messages about it are coming from all the planets and satellites of the Solar System.<br><br>And then our old customer appears again - <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>. We were extremely lucky to find that compact data bank at the Civil Resistance base. It seems that AnCom is hiding success in advanced experiments with quasimorphosis carried out behind the backs of the other hexarchs. <color=#FFFEC1>HIS Unveiled</color>, owned by AnCom, has been in the orbit of Venus for a while and is clearly engaged in a comprehensive study of its surface. And now they have shared something with us.<br><br>As we thought, accusing the <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> of fabricating quasimorphic activity on Venus is a lie. It seems that <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color> is trying to drag its “court” into our world: the quasimorphs of its bramfatura. There are reports of successful phasing of huge structures. But people like us have the opportunity to raise prices and start getting <color=#FFFEC1>real</color> pleasure.						
mission.CommunityAndAnarchy.briefing	Our scanners can't trace the device, it is likely located somewhere in the underground levels. Look for the elevator down. The geodesic is partially destroyed, so we will drop you right on the territory of the colony. I'm noticing some other signals, but they're not quasimorphs. I think these are some poorly armed marauders: former <color=#FFFEC1>Fresco</color> Sec officers, fugitive PMCs, pirates who broke into the Inner System, and so on. Shouldn't be any problems.						
mission.CommunityAndAnarchy.objective0	You need to pick up the AnCom device if it really is <color=#FFFEC1>their</color> device. You will have to search all over <color=#FFFEC1>Oddibjord-3</color>.

It makes sense to re-think who exactly we should continue to cooperate with. Apparently <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>, <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color>, and even <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color> are all very interested in obtaining the recovered device... Or artifact?

mission.RuinsOfAncientBramfaturas.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Task:</color> Acquire Tezctlan's Spear.<br><br>						
mission.RuinsOfAncientBramfaturas.details	<color=#FFFEC1>Details:</color> Xiomara informed us that in the Sinkhole Oasis, a research colony on Mars, we can find an extremely valuable quasimorphic artifact. According to her, we can destroy Tezctlan with its help. If everything is as she says, this weapon will be our trump card in the big game that has begun in the System.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Additional Info:</color> Thanks to Xiomara, we have learned a lot about bramfatura and quasimorphosis. Xiomara is the Duchess of Gannix, the bramfatura of Venus, who is now at war with her kind. About 1000 years ago, Tezctlan became a hylonaut. This means he went to Earth, and such quasimorphs are no longer capable of escaping our native planet independently. Our analysts report that this happened around the 13th-14th centuries CE. When Tezctlan disappeared from Gannix, Xiomara took power there. With Tezctlan's return, the situation changed for her. Following Dr. Eipschwitz's lead, we drove her and her loyal knights, the Order of Feathered Masks, back to Gannix.<br><br>During one of our missions on Venus, Xiomara contacted us again. We made a deal and started receiving tasks from her. It helped the Feathered Masks survive in their fight against Tezctlan. It seems to be effectively curbing his activities.<br><br>Now she claims that in the Sinkhole Oasis, a geological research colony on Mars, we can find Tezctlan's spear. When we try to find out how it got there, the duchess vaguely mentions an ancient attack on Mars and the murder of its king. Our analysts speculate that this somehow relates to the absence of quasimorphosis on Mars. In any case, before unlocking all the secrets of the Sinkhole Oasis, we will have to deal with those who currently own it.						
mission.RuinsOfAncientBramfaturas.briefing	The station is broadcasting something strange. Some prayers, chants, music... Human speech in... ancient Sumerian? That doesn't sound like RealWare. The station must be under attack. That's fortunate. In the chaos, we can get the shuttle a little closer than we planned. Attack the Sinkhole Oasis and make your way to the Monolith. Our task is to destroy it and finally obtain Tezctlan's spear.

mission.RuinsOfAncientBramfaturas.after	Good news: we now have the spear. The bad news: Mars and the satellites, until now completely free of quasimorphic influence, are now ahead of even Gannix on Venus. This is simultaneously a problem for us, the corporations, and even Tezctlan. They and Urparp haven't exactly had the friendliest of relationships. I'd like to ask Xiomara questions, but that's for you to decide, Boss. What's done is done. Mission accomplished.

mission.UseYourHead.details	"<color=#FFFEC1>Details:</color> Doctor Eipschwitz, whose head we keep in the storage compartment of the Magnum, informed us that at the Fresco Corporation's base, Flat Obsidian, there's the Telephature Dislocator: a device capable of transporting people into the bramfaturas of planets. We need to ensure the security of the device and load it onto the Shuttle.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Additional Info:</color> On the Flat Obsidian base, there were structures to accommodate the PMC Tifton and a phased Venusian temple. Our analysts were puzzled over how a temple from Venus could end up on Mercury. It turned out that Eipschwitz is a great connoisseur of quasimorphosis. He talks about some ""ancient roads"" and much more. We'll investigate this further. It was there that we first encountered Xiomara and eliminated her following Eipschwitz's lead.<br><br>After what happened to Fresco, the base became completely unusable. However, Eipschwitz reports that there's another completely secret laboratory site. Hidden among the rocks, the Telephaturic Dislocator stands right on the surface of Mercury. We just need to land the shuttle nearby, make sure everything is quiet, and retrieve the device.<br><br>The Telephaturic Dislocator consumes a lot of energy (that's why Mercury was chosen, an inexhaustible source of heat) to open gates that allow physical objects to transition into the bramfaturas of planets."

mission.UseYourHead.after	"Eipschwitz is still catatonic. We hooked him up to a virtual simulation and, by repeating his actions, assembled some kind of device. The doctor called it ""the ultimate solution to the damn terrorists and quasimorphs."" It's obviously a bomb, mass producing it requires some sophisticated components, but if we can get them we can get production on stream. I suppose with a bomb like this we could try to raid the Sinkhole Oasis and destroy the Monolith after all. It doesn't sound like a very convincing plan, Boss, but it's the best we've got."

Ganix had not seen him for a thousand years. Only a few months ago, the quasimorphs of Venus felt his return. The Fresco corporation's transport spacecraft brought a fragment of an ancient temple wall from the city of Aztlan on Earth to the planet. Tetzclan slept inside, depicted by a primitive image of himself. After that, Dr. Eipshwitz found a way to infiltrate the ancient king's dreams and learned the method of awakening from him. Fresco decided to take this step to save their corporation from destruction.<br><br>The only reason Tetzclan did not immediately seize power was Xiomara. However, we dealt with her.

mission.Corp_Corp_Elimination1.details	<color=#FFFEC1>Details:</color> Fair competition is the key to rapid progress in science. How is this described in <color=#FFFEC1>NCE</color>?
