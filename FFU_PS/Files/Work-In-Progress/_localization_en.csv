ui.settings.help.general_content	<color=#FFFEC0>Quasimorph</color> is a turn-based rogue-like game.<br><br>Health Points<br>Health is a key indicator of the character's condition. When health drops to zero, the character dies. Health can be restored by using autodocs, medkits, treating wounds with high-quality fixing materials, or maintaining a good diet.<br><br>Movement<br>Depending on the chosen type of movement, the player has a different number of actions per turn. Sneaky movement is slow and grants only one action point per turn but provides bonuses to stealth and allows interaction with doors, objects, and inventory without spending action points. Normal movement grants two action points per turn without any penalties or bonuses. Sprinting is the fastest. It grants three action points per turn, but the player cannot interact with doors, objects, or inventory. Each movement type consumes a different amount of calories per action, which is a key parameter for your character. A high-calorie reserve activates natural regeneration (+1 HP per turn), while a low reserve leads to atrophy (-1 HP per turn). Activating character’s perks also consumes calories. Don't be surprised that the satiety level drops so quickly. The heroes you control are clones with their metabolism turned up to maximum.<br><br>Perks<br>Active perks are triggered automatically when certain activation conditions are met. Each perk has its own trigger. After activating a perk, the character receives temporary bonuses and gradually improves the perk through gained experience. Passive perks constantly affect the player, and just like active perks, their level rises up when the character performs the specified actions, such as shooting a specific weapon or moving while overloaded, and so on.<br><br>Quasimorphosis<br>Quasimorphosis level increases due to the influence of subtle things residing in the bramfaturas of the Solar System's planets. These things are called quasimorphs. At low quasimorphosis levels, enemies behave passively, but as it increases, they become more aggressive. At higher levels a breakthrough may occur between the subtle and physical realms, granting demons the ability to manifest. Manifested demons always spend their first turn phasing, during which they exist between two realities and are invulnerable to weapons, but they also cannot attack the player’s character.<br><br>Wounds<br>Successful attacks on the character can not only reduce health but also cause wounds. To heal wounds it is necessary to use items with wound-fixing properties. The effectiveness of such fixation depends on the wound and the type of item used. However, even a fixed wound has a chance of infection, so it is useful to apply antibiotics or sorbents. A fixed wound may be healed over time or reopened. In the latter case, the fixation procedure needs to be repeated. Morphine and First-Aid Kits allow the fixation of all current wounds and can be used from fast slots even while sprinting. An autodoc heals all wounds with a single charge excluding amputations. Particularly strong substances such as morphine, alcohol, cigarettes, and gavvakh can cause addiction. Each type of addiction has its own penalties. Repeated use of the substance will reverse the progression of the addiction, but will not cure it. Having a sharp melee weapon in the inventory allows for the amputation procedure. Be careful! Amputating some body parts is fatal.<br><br>Weapons and Armor<br>In the areas where your PMC operates, there is always an abundance of weapons. Each type of ranged weapon has its own type of ammunition and different rates of fire. Acquaint yourself with not only the characteristics of the weapons but also the ammunition, many of them have special effects. In addition to the usual damage types, there are also composite types: explosive (blunt and piercing) and plasma (cutting and fire). The appropriate lowest value of two armor attributes protects against it. Over time weapons may break. You can always disassemble weapons you don’t use into spare parts. You can repair the weapons you use with these parts. Same goes for armor. Cloth can be disassembled into rags. Fabric is necessary for wound fixation (see above) as well as for repairing other cloth and backpacks. Broken weapons cannot be used and broken armor does not provide damage resistance. Your items will spill out every turn if the backpack or the vest holding them are broken. Accuracy, dodge, and armor damage reduction have upper caps and bonuses for exceeding them. If the accuracy becomes more than 95%, then every 10% above increases the chance of a critical hit by 1%, after which the accuracy decreases to 95%. If the dodge becomes more than 95%, then every 10% above will reduce the chance of getting a wound by 1%, after which the dodge is reduced to 95%. Armor cannot reduce incoming damage by more than 95% of its value.<br><br>Interactive Objects<br>The elevator is a key object on each floor of the station. It transports the player to the next floor. Useful items can be found in closets, drawers, and shelves. Medical cases and weapon crates contain corresponding items. Autodocs allow for healing and treating wounds. To use them, one charge is required, and you can replenish the charge by spending a certain number of energy batteries. The level scanner provides more information about the current level on the mini-map. It also uses energy batteries to gather new data. Doors can not only be opened but also closed or locked. Interaction options with the door are available by right-clicking, as well as information about enemies.<br><br>Factions and missions<br>The strength of a faction is determined by two parameters: Power and Technology. Power affects the number of enemies and the loot on a mission. Technology determines the equipment available to factions, which they can use or sell. These parameters grow over time depending on the stations in the faction's possession, but they are also affected by completed missions. Sabotage reduces the station owner's Power and Technology. Espionage reduces the station owner's Technology. Elimination reduces the victim's Power, but if the target was a scientist then Technology. Capture will change the owner of the station, and Defense, on the contrary, will prevent this change. If a faction has not fully paid out the reward for a mission it will accumulate a debt that can be used in the next barter. Factions and their characteristics can be viewed in the first tab of the Stock Exchange.<br><br>Barter and market<br>Since PMCs are illegal organizations they are not connected to the system-wide trading network and are not included in the economy based on reputation. However, corporations agree to exchange some items for others with PMCs. Keep in mind that the items offered by corporations have a fixed value and can be expensive. The items accepted depend on the station where the exchange takes place and may change over time. Current required items can be viewed in the station description. The game works on the principle of Supply and Demand, stations use the items they receive to produce goods, and then sell them to other stations in the system. Because of this the price of bartered items can change greatly. You can view current prices and their dynamics in the second tab of the Stock Exchange. To exchange without having to visit stations, you can enable Fast Trade in the settings.<br><br>

ui.settings.help.faq	faq
ui.settings.help.faq_content	Trade break<br>If your reputation with a faction falls beyond 0 they will null all your accumulated barter points with them.<br><br>Actions<br>There are special conditions in the game like eating, moving, or using actions. Actions in this case include: using inventory, reloading weapons, throwing weapons, throwing grenades, interacting with doors and interactable objects (scanner, autodoc, stove, workbench), using pact abilities.<br><br>Weapon range and character range<br>Weapon range indicates the optimal operating range of the weapon. If the enemy is outside of it then the additional properties of the weapon will not work and for each tile beyond the range the damage received will be reduced. The character's range shows the range of vision.<br><br>Equipment and repairs<br>Weapons and armor wear down over time. If you repair them using various spare parts rather than specialized equipment then with each repair their maximum condition will decrease. Because of this weapons can become completely unusable.<br><br>Shift and Ctrl in inventory<br>Moving an item while holding Shift will transfer all items of that type. If you hold down Ctrl and left-click on an item, it will be transferred from or to the inventory.<br><br>Amputations<br>Amputations are the most severe type of injury. It can’t be healed, only stabilized, temporarily removing damage over time but not the unpleasant effects. Some body parts are tied to each other: hip and foot, shoulder and arm. When amputating the upper part of the body, the lower adjacent part is also amputated. The vital parts of the body are the head, chest, body, and stomach. Their amputation leads to instant death.<br><br>Where are quasimorphs<br>The presence of quasimorphs is indicated in the description of the planets. The satellites of the planets are also influenced by the bramfaturas of the respective planets. The exception is the Moon which has its own bramfatura and affects the celestial bodies nearby. At the beginning of the game there are no quasimorphs on Earth and its artificial satellite Tsiolkovsky, as well as on Mars, Phobos, and Deimos. There are no quasimorphosis or eccolapse on Defense missions.<br><br>Breaking walls<br>All man-made walls can be broken if enough damage is dealt.<br><br>Puddles<br>Any liquids (water, blood, gasoline, poison) can leave behind puddles. If the new puddle is larger or the same size as the old one then the new puddle will replace the old one. Spilled gasoline may ignite due to fire nearby. Puddles of poison are considered Dangerous Tiles and dry up over time.

tutorial.ecolapse.dialog	The phenomenon in which a creature is torn from the inside and a Quasimorph appears in its place is called an <color=#FFFEC1>eccolapse</color>. On the first turn the newly appeared Quasimorph is invulnerable, it phases between our and their realities. At this moment, it makes no sense to fire at it, it’s better to take a tactically more advantageous position.
tutorial.pickup_dataidsk.dialog	Valuable items such as production chips and mercenary mind chips justify the costs of using the shuttle. If you find something like this on a mission, we can evacuate you as part of the standard procedure using the elevator or shuttle.
tutorial.receive_wound.dialog	Injuries are common in combat situations. The first priority is to treat the wound. You can use bandages, splints, or even ordinary rags for that. To obtain a rag, tear up any unnecessary clothing. Autodocs and surgical kits allow you to immediately heal any wound.
tutorial.receive_infection.dialog	Some wounds can become infected. To prevent this, use sorbent or antibiotics.
tutorial.zero_starvation.dialog	Your body constantly requires calories for normal functioning. When satiety drops to zero, the atrophy process begins, which continually reduces your health. Simply eat something. Keep in mind that cannibalism is not encouraged but not prohibited, so if you have melee weapons, you can resort to it.
tutorial.no_ammo_in_weapon.dialog	Almost any weapon consumes ammunition and need to be reloaded. Avoid doing this in the midst of battle because you become vulnerable during the reloading process. Try to find cover.
tutorial.broken_weapon.dialog	Weapons have a tendency to break with regular and active use. To repair them, you can disassemble other unnecessary weaponry or use a repair kit.
tutorial.broken_backpack.dialog	Your backpack has torn. I'll remind you this time but try to keep an eye on the condition of your equipment yourself. Contents will constantly spill out from a torn backpack or rig. To repair it, use any available fabric.
tutorial.mob_throw_grenade.dialog	Enemies can also use offensive grenades. Of course, they do it much worse than our operatives, but there are exceptions. To avoid getting hit by shrapnel, it's better to move to a safe distance and find cover.
tutorial.peaceful_station.dialog	Since we conduct illegal activities, trade transactions between corporations and participants in the dignitas market are not available to us. But given our influence on the Solar System, corporations are ready to barter with us. <br><br>Different stations require different goods, as soon as we bring them and unload them into the station warehouse, the station owners will be happy to exchange them for some of their own items. The course is certainly extortionate, but it's worth it.
tutorial.item_production.dialog	The capacity of our mother spacecraft allows us to produce items directly on board. To produce most simple items, we only need a licensed chip. <br><br>There are examples in history of how one corporation tried to introduce an additional fee for each item produced, but as a result of the six-day war, the corporation went bankrupt, and all the others refused such monetization.
tutorial.first_death.dialog	<color=#FFFEC1>Clones</color> often die on missions, there's nothing to be done about it, but on the other hand, any clone can be reprinted on a <color=#FFFEC1>bioprinter</color>. Plus, we have <color=#FFFEC1>insurance</color> for such cases, which partially compensates for the lost equipment. To do this, find the <color=#FFFEC1>Emergency Case</color> in the Magnum's inventory, right-click on it, and select <color=#FFFEC1>dismantle</color>.
tutorial.jammer.dialog	This device is a communication jammer, EW-thing, interfering transmitter, name it. It jams some of the communication channels between you and Magnum. Therefore, we cannot send you station minimaps. If you destroy the jammer, the channels will be free and the minimap will be accessible. So don't hesitate, shoot.
tutorial.toxic_paddle.dialog	Careful! There are acid puddles next to you. They are difficult to notice but they are extremely dangerous. Avoid them or let them dry.
tutorial.magnumspaceship.dialog	This is the <color=#FFFEC1>HIS Magnum</color> control screen. From here you can access the list of clone operators and the Cargo Hold (Top right corner of the screen). To go to the ship's compartments click on any compartment marker.
tutorial.weaponstation.dialog	This is a list of weapon modification projects. Here you can select the weapon whose chip you have unlocked and improve its characteristics. Keep in mind that the price of modification is growing exponentially, and the number of projects is limited.
tutorial.armorstation.dialog	This is a list of armor modification projects. Here you can select the armor whose chip you have unlocked and improve its characteristics. Keep in mind that the price of modification is growing exponentially, and the number of projects is limited.
tutorial.memorydefrag.dialog	This is a list of class development projects. Here you can select a class and replace its perks with the perks of any other unlocked class. Keep in mind that the development price increases exponentially depending on the number of perks being replaced, and the number of projects is limited.
tutorial.starmap_with_tradeshuttle.dialog	The barter module allows you to load a trade shuttle and send it to any body of the Solar System. Select a planet or a satellite, look at the required items by the stations, load them via the “Trade Shuttle” under the list of stations and send the shuttle. In a few days it will return with the items received after the barter.
tutorial.genomeeditor.dialog	This is a list of clone development projects. Here you can choose a clone of the operator whose chip you unlocked and improve its characteristics or even change their personal perk. Keep in mind that the price of development is growing exponentially, and the number of projects is limited.
tutorial.trainingcenter.dialog	This is a list of operators undergoing training to level up their class perks. The available maximum level for training depends on the unlocked module upgrades.
ui.dialog.applaunch_message	Welcome to the Quasimorph Early Access! Please remember that the game is actively in development, and the current version does not have all the planned features. You can find information about our upcoming plans on the game's page and in the game's main menu. <br><br>And don't forget about bug reports! Most likely, we are already working on fixes but you can help by reporting bugs through the dedicated section in the main menu. <br><br>Hop into our Discord to discuss the game with us and other players, and receive updates before everyone else.
ui.dialog.continuetutorial	Do you want to continue training?
ui.dialog.afterskiptutorial	Supplies on the spacecraft are running low, so we need to find some new profitable <color=#FFFEC1>contracts</color>. We can start working for anyone and make them the dominant power in the System, or we can try to maintain the status quo for the sake of long term profiting from this apocalypse. We can start by returning the <color=#FFFEC1>AnСom's PCPU</color> from our cargo hold to its rightful owners. Or bring it to someone else. Also, if we can land a mighty blow on <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>, there is a chance that he has enemies on <color=#FFFEC1>Venus</color> and they will contact us. It's up to you, <color=#FFFEC1>Boss</color>.
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_1	Good morning, <color=#FFFEC1>Boss</color>. Let's first restore memory after the diapause. During the AnCom mission on Venus, we awakened a quasimorph named <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>. Now his quasimorphs are still in our world, which is weird. There's no information in the news that we're involved.. Meanwhile, corporates insist that quasimorphosis is a fabrication and claim that <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color> is a provocation by <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color>. We are now orbiting <color=#FFFEC1>Phobos</color> and have time to recover and figure out what to do next. The supplies on the spacecraft are running low, so we need to find ourselves some new profitable...
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_2	" <color=#FFFEC1>ATTENTION! ATTENTION!</color> Vector 4, sector 6, northern hemisphere. Five launches detected, rocket engines. Approaching rapidly. Activating countermeasures. <color=#FFFEC1>""Magnum""</color>, grab onto something - it's going to be loud."
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_3	"It seems to be <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color>. We need to clear them out from <color=#FFFEC1>""Magnum""</color>. Our future depends on it."
ui.dialog.tutorial_diapauseCabin1	Let's remember how to move. To navigate, use {0} on the required square or {1} on the keyboard.<br><br> In the bottom-left corner of the screen, you'll find your energy reserve, pain threshold counter, health, and movement mode. The <color=#FFFEC1>Movement mode</color> determines how many action points you have until opponents take their turn.<br><br> Make sure no one is behind you, press {2} to <color=#FFFEC1>look around</color>. In the closet behind you, you'll find standard equipment, use it.
 En la esquina inferior izquierda de la pantalla, encontrarás tu reserva de energía, el contador de umbral de dolor, la salud y el modo de movimiento. El <color=#FFFEC1>modo de movimiento</color> determina cuántos puntos de acción tienes hasta que los oponentes realicen su turno.<br><br> Asegúrate de que no haya nadie detrás de ti, presiona {2} para <color=#FFFEC1>mirar alrededor</color>. En el armario detrás de ti, encontrarás equipo estándar, úsalo.	Przypomnijmy sobie, jak się poruszać. Aby poruszać się, użyj {0} na odpowiednim kwadracie lub {1} na klawiaturze.<br><br>
 W lewym dolnym rogu ekranu znajdziesz swoją rezerwę energii, licznik progu bólu, zdrowie i tryb ruchu. <color=#FFFEC1>Tryb ruchu</color> określa, ile masz punktów akcji, zanim przeciwnicy podejmą swoją turę.<br><br> Upewnij się, że za tobą nie ma nikogo, naciśnij {2}, aby <color=#FFFEC1>rozglądać się</color>. W szafie za tobą znajduje się standardowe wyposażenie, użyj go.	Nasıl hareket edeceğimizi hatırlayalım. Hareket etmek için, gereken karede {0} veya klavyede {1} tuşunu kullanın.<br><br>
 Ekranın sol alt köşesinde enerji rezervinizi, ağrı eşiği sayacınızı, sağlığı ve hareket modunu bulacaksınız. <color=#FFFEC1>Hareket modu</color>, rakiplerin sırayla oyun yapmadan önce kaç eylem puanınız olduğunu belirler.<br><br> Arkanda kimse olmadığından emin olun, etrafına bakmak için {2} tuşuna basın. Arkandaki dolapta standart ekipman bulunmaktadır, onu kullanın.	Vamos lembrar como se mover. Para navegar, use {0} no quadrado desejado ou {1} no teclado.<br><br> No canto inferior esquerdo da tela, você encontrará sua reserva de energia, contador do limite de dor, saúde e modo de movimento. O <color=#FFFEC1>modo de movimento</color> determina quantos pontos de ação você tem até que os oponentes joguem.<br><br> Certifique-se de que ninguém esteja atrás de você, pressione {2} para <color=#FFFEC1>olhe ao redor</color>. No armário atrás de você você encontrará equipamentos padrão, use-os.
 屏幕左下角显示有能量储备、疼痛阈值计数表、健康和移动模式。 <color=#FFFEC1>移动模式</color> 确定在敌人轮到之前你有多少行动点。<br><br> 确保你身后没有人， 按 {2} 键 <color=#FFFEC1>四处看看</color>。请使用在你身后橱箱里面的一套标准装备。	
ui.dialog.tutorial_diapauseCabin2	Leave the cabin and head to the <color=#FFFEC1>elevator</color>, it's in the room across. We need to eliminate all these bastards.
ui.dialog.tutorial_diapauseCabin3	If you press key {0}, you can get information about the <color=#FFFEC1>mission status</color> or request <color=#FFFEC1>evacuation</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Evacuation</color> is done via elevator or shuttle. But right now, we have nowhere to retreat...
ui.dialog.tutorial_diapauseCabin4	To move between station levels, use <color=#FFFEC1>elevators</color> or <color=#FFFEC1>stairs</color>. In the elevator control window, all floors connected by the elevator shaft are displayed. Press the floor you need. I strongly recommend starting with the <color=#FFFEC1>Medbay</color>. If we lose the <color=#FFFEC1>bioprinter</color>, there will be serious difficulties in cloning you or other fighters.
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock1	This is the <color=#FFFEC1>Medbay</color>, where the <color=#FFFEC1>bioprinter</color> is located. A perfect place to remind you about your health. If your health reaches zero, you will die. If your pain threshold reaches its limit, you will skip a turn. Damage you receive can lead to injuries or limb loss. Keep an eye on that. Take a close look at the health interface by pressing the {0} key.
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock2	I'm sending a signal to your computer about a new <color=#FFFEC1>wound</color>; you need to fix it. To do this, press {0} on the medical kit to your right, then select the injured body part.
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock3	It seems you've acquired an <color=#FFFEC1>infection</color>. Open your inventory by pressing {0} and use a <color=#FFFEC1>sorbent</color> or <color=#FFFEC1>antibiotic</color>. If the wound is not fixed, the <color=#FFFEC1>infection</color> develops faster.
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock4	In extreme cases, you can perform an <color=#FFFEC1>amputation</color>. To do this, select 'amputate' in the context menu of a <color=#FFFEC1>sharp object</color> and choose the <color=#FFFEC1>body part</color>. Note that you can't bandage yourself while in sprint mode.
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock5	<color=#FFFEC1>AutoDoc</color> allows you to treat wounds or infections if it has <color=#FFFEC1>charges</color>. You can recharge it with standard <color=#FFFEC1>batteries</color>. Hurry, I've spotted an <color=#FFFEC1>enemy</color> in the room below you. Deal with them.
ui.dialog.tutorial_medblock6	Great job. Pay attention to the body. Click on it to <color=#FFFEC1>loot</color>. If you want to <color=#FFFEC1>stand on the corpse</color> without inspecting it, use {0} for movement. When you're done here, return to the elevator and descend to the next level. In the top right corner, there's a <color=#FFFEC1>minimap</color> and the current <color=#FFFEC1>mission status</color>. Use these buttons if you forget what's happening.
ui.dialog.tutorial_arsenal1	And here's our <color=#FFFEC1>arsenal</color>. Ammo and melee weapons have different <color=#FFFEC1>damage types</color>, and armor has different <color=#FFFEC1>resistance types</color>. Choose wisely with what and how to attack to win.
ui.dialog.tutorial_arsenal2	Let's make sure your <color=#FFFEC1>weapon</color> is loaded and ready for battle. To reload your weapon, press {0}. If the ammo is in the <color=#FFFEC1>tactical vest slot</color> in the middle of the screen, press the corresponding quick-access slot key, and reloading will take fewer turns.<br><br> You have two <color=#FFFEC1>weapon slots</color>. You can quickly switch between them by clicking on the image of the active weapon in the top left or by pressing the {1} button.
 Tienes dos <color=#FFFEC1>ranuras para armas</color>. Puedes cambiar rápidamente entre ellas haciendo clic en la imagen del arma activa en la parte superior izquierda o usando la tecla {1}.	Upewnijmy się, że twoja <color=#FFFEC1>broń</color> jest naładowana i gotowa do walki. Aby naładować broń, naciśnij {0}. Jeśli naboje znajdują się w <color=#FFFEC1>slocie kamizelki taktycznej</color> pośrodku ekranu, naciśnij odpowiednią klawiszem slotu szybkiego dostępu, a przeładowanie zajmie mniej tur.<br><br>
 Masz dwie <color=#FFFEC1>przestrzenie na broń</color>. Możesz szybko między nimi przełączać, klikając na obrazie aktywnej broni u góry po lewej lub używając klawisza {1}.	Haydi, <color=#FFFEC1>silahının</color> şarjlı ve savaşa hazır olduğundan emin olalım. Silahını şarj etmek için {0}'e bas. Mermiler <color=#FFFEC1>taktik yeleğin yuvasında</color> ise, hızlı erişim yuvasının ilgili tuşuna bas ve şarj daha az tur alır.<br><br> İki <color=#FFFEC1>silah yuvasına</color> sahipsin. Onlar arasında hızlıca geçiş yapabilirsin, sol üstteki etkin silahın resmine tıklayarak veya {1} tuşunu kullanarak.
 2つの<color=#FFFEC1>武器スロット</color>があります。左上のアクティブな武器の画像をクリックするか、キー{1}を使用して素早く切り替えることができます。	让我们确保你的<color=#FFFEC1>武器</color>已经装填好，随时可以参与战斗。重新装填武器，请按 {0} 键。如果子弹是在屏幕中央的<color=#FFFEC1>战术背心槽</color>里，按下相应的快速访问槽键。这样再把武器装填好所需花的回合会少得多。<br><br> 你有两个<color=#FFFEC1>武器槽</color>。你可以通过点击左上角的活动武器图像或使用按键 {1} 快速切换它们。
ui.dialog.tutorial_arsenal3	I suggest hiding behind the <color=#FFFEC1>cover</color> to make it harder for enemies to hit us. To do this, stand on the highlighted square.<br><br> The <color=#FFFEC1>cover</color> can stop a bullet if you're not shooting directly from behind it. If your shooting trajectory intersects the cover, it will be highlighted in red.
 Die <color=#FFFEC1>Deckung</color> kann eine Kugel stoppen, wenn du nicht direkt von dahinter schießt. Wenn deine Schussbahn die Deckung kreuzt, wird sie rot markiert.	Je suggère de se mettre à l'abri derrière la <color=#FFFEC1>couverture</color> pour que les ennemis aient moins de facilité à nous toucher. Pour ce faire, placez-vous sur la case en surbrillance.<br><br> La <color=#FFFEC1>couverture</color> peut arrêter une balle si vous ne tirez pas directement derrière lui. Si la trajectoire de tir croise l'abri, il sera mis en surbrillance en rouge.
 假如你不直接从<color=#FFFEC1>掩体</color>的后面射击，其可以挡子弹。如果弹道与掩体相交，它将以红亮显示。	
ui.dialog.tutorial_arsenal4	Great. Here's some more useful information. If you ever want to shoot somewhere other than the enemy, hold {0}. Your cursor will change to a <color=#FFFEC1>crosshair</color>, and the shooting trajectory will be displayed.<br>We have a <color=#FFFEC1>fuel barrel</color> for the flamethrower; you can blow it up with a shot... Just don't catch fire yourself. <color=#FFFEC1>Fire is very dangerous!</color>
ui.dialog.tutorial_arsenal5	To the right of the active weapon is the button to select the <color=#FFFEC1>shooting mode</color>. Hover the cursor over it to see the advantages and disadvantages of each.
ui.dialog.tutorial_machineBlock1	Someone threw <color=#FFFEC1>grenades</color> into the Machine Room again; I'll deal with them later. <color=#FFFEC1>Grenades</color> are used from the <color=#FFFEC1>utility belt slots</color>. Activate grenade usage with the corresponding hotkey or pressing {0}. Once you're done here, head to the <color=#FFFEC1>cubecentric engine</color> on the left.
ui.dialog.tutorial_machineBlock2	<color=#FFFEC1>Colnodes</color> have barricaded themselves in the upper compartment. Get ready for a serious battle. Use cover and don't play the hero. We have several stationary <color=#FFFEC1>turrets and mines</color>. They are used in the same way: from the inventory with {0}. Opening the context menu, you need to select <color=#FFFEC1>‘use’</color>. Turret or mine in this case will be installed in the cell next to you - in the direction you are facing. Prepare for defense; we have a little time.<br><br>Just in case, the key for skipping a turn is {1}. It might be useful if you need to wait for a few turns.
ui.dialog.tutorial_machineBlock3	Destroy them before they blow up the <color=#FFFEC1>Cubecentric Engine!</color> Use everything I've already told you, the goal is to protect the <color=#FFFEC1>‘Magnum’</color>.
ui.dialog.tutorial_end	Well done, <color=#FFFEC1>Frank</color>. All invaders eliminated, and <color=#FFFEC1>‘Magnum’</color> is no longer under threat. See you at the <color=#FFFEC1>Bridge</color>. Over and out.
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_4	We can certainly do as <color=#FFFEC1>Jane</color> said. Contracts are waiting. But as the saying goes: <color=#FFFEC1>'Honor is lost, everything is lost; honor is preserved, everything is preserved.'</color>. We were able to track down the exact locations of the shuttlepods launches - it's <color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color>. Most likely, <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> has set up a training center and a transshipment point there. Before we start chasing money, I suggest to stick a red-hot poker in the red's ass.
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_5	Great, I'm glad that honor is not an empty word to you, <color=#FFFEC1>Boss</color>. Just in case, I'll remind you about the standard mission preparation interface. On this screen, you choose the operative who will go on the mission, the chip with combat skills that will be integrated into the freshly printed clone, and the equipment that we will issue to the fighter for the mission.
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_6	This is the <color=#FFFEC1>bioprinter screen</color>. Here you can choose a fighter to go on a mission. The list includes both those who survived previous missions and those who need to be printed. Each of the fighters has their own parameters and unique <color=#FFFEC1>talent</color>. They have all been through a lot during years of combat in every corner of the <color=#FFFEC1>Solar System</color>.
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_7	This is the <color=#FFFEC1>class selection screen</color>. In addition to their own experience, each fighter will benefit from gaining a specific set of skills based on the experience of past military conflicts and digitized experience of special forces. Each <color=#FFFEC1>class</color> has a set of passive abilities and trigger abilities that are activated under certain conditions.
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_8	Now you need to <color=#FFFEC1>gather your equipment</color>. Take whatever you deem necessary, but don't forget ammo, food, and medical supplies. Note that if the operative you send dies in battle, all the items will be lost, and <color=#FFFEC1>evacuation</color> is only possible when the <color=#FFFEC1>mission is completed</color> or we find something valuable like a new <color=#FFFEC1>consciousness chip</color>.
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_9	Great, if you feel ready, it's time to press the <color=#FFFEC1>Start Mission</color> button.
ui.dialog.tutorial2_cargodock1	Our scanners see several ways to solve this problem. First, there is the main <color=#FFFEC1>elevator</color> connecting the <color=#FFFEC1>Cargo Dock</color> to the <color=#FFFEC1>Control Center</color>, but the number of biosignatures at the <color=#FFFEC1>elevator</color> is extremely high. Obviously, there is a quite <color=#FFFEC1>strong security</color> there. Secondly, there is a bypass route through the <color=#FFFEC1>stairs and warehouse level</color>. I would recommend using the second option as our main plan, but if you feel confident, you can act as you think best.
ui.dialog.tutorial2_cargodock2	Some room nearby is an <color=#FFFEC1>Elevator</color>. Be careful, the signatures of stationary turrets and heavily armored <color=#FFFEC1>colnodes</color> are clearly tracked there. Whatever kills them can kill you too. You are not special, and equipment tends to run out.
ui.dialog.tutorial2_cargodock3	This <color=#FFFEC1>stairs</color> leads to the warehouse premises. We have enhanced the resolution capability of the geoscanner, there's medical supplies and some other equipment there. Use everything, and you will easily reach the <color=#FFFEC1>SD control center</color>.
ui.dialog.tutorial2_cmdcenter1	Finally, you're at the <color=#FFFEC1>SD control center</color>. It's full of <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> fighters. A bioscanner is registering spikes in their endocrine systems - it's madness. Maybe there's a way to bypass them? Pay attention to the technical corridors and ventilation shafts. If you picked up <color=#FFFEC1>heavy weaponry</color> from the warehouse, you shouldn't have many problems. Once you find their <color=#FFFEC1>PCO control computer</color>, just destroy it with whatever's at hand.
ui.dialog.tutorial2_cmdcenter2	Great job. Pilots began maneuver as soon as the geoscanner beeped that the <color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color> guns died. Mission accomplished. Request <color=#FFFEC1>evacuation</color> and return to the nearest <color=#FFFEC1>elevator</color>.
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_10	In front of you, there is a map of the <color=#FFFEC1>Solar System</color>. Here you can see which <color=#FFFEC1>missions</color> are available in different areas and how much <color=#FFFEC1>time it will take to travel</color> from one point to another. Right now, to deliver the PCPU with quasimorphic research to <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>, we need to go to <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color>. Boss... One more thing. The system is open to us and full of possibilities. You are under no obligation to return the device to its rightful owner. But I wouldn’t risk getting involved with <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>. And... This is the last piece of advice that I gave you.
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_11	Choose the <color=#FFFEC1>Rebus Sky City</color> to visit. It's a <color=#FFFEC1>peaceful station</color>, so there's no need to equip the operative who will go there. Also, when we send clones to perform <color=#FFFEC1>barter</color>, we load all the items into the shuttle, so there's no need to make multiple trips if something is forgotten. When you are ready, take the <color=#FFFEC1>PCPU</color> with the research and send the operative.
ui.dialog.tutorial3_rebus1	Have you brought us our <color=#FFFEC1>intellectual property</color>? Great. Find our representative here at the station and deliver the <color=#FFFEC1>PCPU</color>. To do this, click on the <color=#FFFEC1>pile of boxes</color> next to him. Place the PCPU in the opened inventory window and press the <color=#FFFEC1>“Exchange”</color> button. This is how <color=#FFFEC1>barter</color> works at all peaceful stations where you are allowed to land. When you’re done, return to the shuttle and get out of here. 
ui.dialog.tutorial3_rebus2	Good work, <color=#FFFEC1>mercenary</color>. If you need contracts, we regularly distribute them through the <color=#FFFEC1>SBN</color> channels. Work for us and you will become rich. But if you stand in our way, the consequences will be dreadful. I hope we understood each other.
ui.dialog.spacemodetutorial_12	I can't stand these corporates... <color=#FFFEC1>Boss</color>, what next? It seems like you and <color=#FFFEC1>Frank</color> have satisfied your sense of justice. We're free now. There's chaos all over the System. Taking advantage of the sudden appearance of <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorphs</color>, the corporations have reshuffled the market. Stations change owners almost every day. <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>, who seems to favor us for its awakening, is squeezing the corporations on <color=#FFFEC1>Venus</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> has been showing some furious activity around <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color>. Maybe we should continue fighting against them if we get paid for it? There's no <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorphosis</color> there, so it will be easier.<br><br>We can start working for anyone and make them the mighty power in the System, or we can try to maintain the status quo for the sake of long-term profit from this apocalypse. Also we can decide that Tezctlan is too big a threat to all humanity. We can start fighting against him, hoping that someone will join us. It's up to you, <color=#FFFEC1>Boss</color>.
ui.dialog.ksiomara_orbit_1	Is that you? I remember you. I've been waiting, hoping that you would show up again. And here you are. You've come close enough to Gannix for my call to reach your mind. But this proximity is not enough for us to make a pact. Do not fear, it will be beneficial for both of us. We have something to offer each other. Do you know why Quasimorphosis occurs in the solid realm? Why the barons come to you? To meet me, go to Venus and simply do your job. Massacre them the way you always do. Murders, cannibalism, people screaming in agony. I will sense the sweet aroma of Gavvakh, and I will know it's you. And I will come to you in person. Then we will discuss the terms of our alliance.
ui.dialog.ksiomara_venus_gift1	Oh yeah, I'm coming. Agony, the cries of the dying, pain leaving your bodies with the blood - all this in the solid realm looks very different inside Gannix. To us, it is a sweet-voiced choir of ecstasy. Gavvakh flows out of your bodies with blood, torment, and life itself. It streams through your realm and seeps into ours. And we can drink it. Taltnoms crave Gavvakh. Taltnoms want Gavvakh.<br><br>Gavvakh gives us power. Once we are satiated with Gavvakh, we can tear through the invisible fabric separating our realm from yours. First, we whisper to you. Then, we tempt you. Then, we change you. And finally, when you have been turned into our servants and Gavvakh is flowing, we can reveal ourselves. We do not lose our immortality. Our death in Kenom is merely an exile back to Gannix.<br><br>So when you killed me on Mercury, I did not die. Accept my gift, and we will make a pact. You will become my servant. I will give you the power to resist Tezctlan and protect the solid realm, your realm. Now finish the job you came here for. I will help you.
ui.dialog.ksiomara_orbit_2	I granted you the Skull of the Feathered Serpent so that you could make a pact with me. It is already on the way to your Ethereal Ship
ui.dialog.ksiomara_pact_activated	"Finally! You have kept your end of the bargain. From now on, we are bound by an unbreakable pact. Together, we will destroy Tezctlan. We must do this! Once a freedom fighter, first among equals in the emerald crystal of Gannix, the king has gone mad. He must be stopped. He dreams of the Emerald Empire, wishes to expand it beyond Gannix. But he himself had once fought against an insane tyrant possessed by the same delusions.<br><br>I will stay in your realm, on Venus. I will gather the Taltnoms loyal to Liberty and fight the madman here. You must head to Mars. There's a place you call Sinkhole Oasis. It's an ancient battlefield. Long before a human ancestor looked up to the stars in fear, a battle took place there. Tezctlan himself took part in it. He emerged victorious, but there he lost his spear. Itzpapalotl, the symbol of the ruler's fate in the Emerald Kingdom, was forever cast on Mars. If you acquire this spear, it is with its help that you will be able to defeat the madman. For your realm, it is salvation from the monster, for Gannix, it is the path to freedom."""
ui.dialog.tezctlan_pact_activated	Fool! I am Tezctlan, the emperor of eternal Gannix, the lord of the boundless Emerald Empire, the scourge cutting the thread of fate, the leader of legions flying the banners of eagle, jaguar, boa constrictor, and caiman! I am the one who has experienced worship, I am the one who will take Gagtungr's place, I am the one who is truly worthy to rule the Solar System. I am the punishment sent by the universe. Bow your head, mortal. Submit. Accept your fate. In a realm devoid of the golden light of the Sun, the green radiance of Gannix will bring life and death.
ui.dialog.realware_denied	Magnum, listen up. This is the head of security at the Sinkhole Oasis geological station. I'm speaking on behalf of the RealWare Corporation. RealWare is committed to the open market and NCE regulations, unlike you. Your visit to the station is not in our interest. You have nothing to offer us. If you don't change course within the next 30 seconds, the artillery of our planetary defense system will blast your HIS to atoms. The countdown starts. Over and out.
ui.dialog.jane_denied	"Translating from corporate to human, Boss. There's definitely something beyond the scope of the geological station's work at Sinkhole Oasis. RealWare will only let us in if they trust us enough. We'll have to do some work for them if we really need to get in there."""
ui.dialog.jane_sinkhole_visited	This is a peaceful visit, weapons are prohibited. However, RealWare trusts us enough to let us wander around the station in search of something interesting. We've switched Magnum's geoscanner to passive mode to avoid drawing unnecessary attention. So, search the old-fashioned way. Maybe there's a poorly guarded emergency exit or something. Lady Xiomara sent us here for a reason. Be careful, remember that you literally shoved your arm into RealWare's mouth.
ui.dialog.jane_sinkhole_find_ladder	Yes, this is what we've been looking for. The staircase leads to the inner chambers, and it seems there's no alarm here. We can infiltrate the place relatively unnoticed. However, if you run into any security operatives, they will shoot to kill. Stay cautious and only go down after you're ready for a combat mission.
ui.dialog.jane_sinkhole_condition	Find the Spear of Tezctlan
ui.dialog.sinkhole_ladder_denied	The owner of the station will do not like if you use this backdoor. You should better stay in the safety zone.
ui.dialog.jane_sinkhole_after_ladder	We're utilizing the surprise effect to its fullest. Our techies have hacked into Sinkhole Oasis servers and are overloading its network with information noise. You have some time to figure out what's going on here. Find the spear Lady Xiomara mentioned, and gather any valuable data if possible.
ui.dialog_jane_see_monolith	What do you see? When you switched to direct actions, we activated the geoscanner. As soon as we scanned the room you're in, it froze up, outputting data that gave our operator a seizure. What on earth is in there? No wonder RealWare is so diligently filtering access to Sinkhole Oasis. Maybe you need to destroy this bloody thing and retrieve the spear from it.
ui.dialog_jane_attacked_monolith	Well, that was a bad idea. A very bad idea. Firstly, you didn't budge a single atom of this thing with your shot. Secondly, the alarm went off. All armed RealWare security operatives are heading your way. We need some information on this Monolith. Gather it, and we'll get you out.
ui.dialog_jane_sinkhole_data_taken	Excellent, this data should suffice. We didn't get the spear, but we can plan our next moves. Return to the elevator; we'll figure out a way to get you out. Let's hope for the best.
ui.dialog.sinkhole_mission_failed	We managed to come up with some excuses, but RealWare still suspects us. Our reputation has been compromised.
ui.dialog.jane_after_sinkhole	The data we acquired suggests that this entire Monolith is nothing but a phased feature. But first of all, this event occurred about a billion years ago, and secondly, it completely defies the laws of our universe. We're not the first to try breaking it. RealWare has tried every weapon available to them, including a controlled nuclear blast. The result has always been the same - no result. Looks like we have nothing...
ui.dialog.eipschwitz_after_sinkhole	Exactly. You understand NOTHING! This is a priceless find. The Monolith not only phased into our realm from the bramfatura of Mars, but at the time of phasing, it was something entirely different than just a stone. Your problems won't be solved by anyone other than Dr. Eipshwitz. Since I'm now traveling on your spacecraft, can I finally be considered your employee? Let's get closer to mutually beneficial cooperation. NCE. Freedom to contract. Remember?<br><br>Well, well... I'll need my Telefaturic Dislocator, several boxes of spare parts and repair kits, and I'll need a lab space on the ship and a lab coat... Ah, no. No coat needed. But a couple of handy assistants are.<br><br>Where did I put the Dislocator? You didn't take it back from Mercury? Hm... seems it should still be at Flat Obsidian, in the field camp. We need to evacuate it from there so I can get to work.
ui.dialog.eipschwitz_see_dislocator	I distinctly remember it standing right here! It was stolen! Those filthy colnodian hands think they have the right to touch my property? This is very fragile and infinitely valuable equipment! Search the whole damn station, it's gotta be here somewhere. I need i… I mean, we need it!
ui.dialog.eipschwitz_see_dislocator_parts	What?! Barbarians. Vandals. One, two, three, four, ten, sixty-two. The Dislocator was perfectly dismantled into four parts! Four! Even a colnode with one hand and no thumb can count to four! These idiots have destroyed a masterpiece of human thought! They've pushed all modern science back to the Stone Age! I'll have to start development practically from scratch again. So... I need alloys, microchips, nails... Yeah, maybe four or eight this time? We need to consider our previous experience... Yes... Hm...
ui.dialog.ruins1_realware	Embraced by the mission of the Blood Warriors, from the beginning we know the Realm of Ur, a realm that lies beyond the boundaries of the physical universe. This is our true fatherland. We know Urparp, guardian of the Bright Throne of Gagtungr. To Him we give the glory that comes from our mouth. We also know the created realm. To it we send our curses. We serve the Conqueror Worm, who bestowed the title of Blood Warriors upon us. From the beginning, we remember Him, the father of our spirit, the Ancient Terror for the Manifested Realm. Embraced by the mission of the Blood Warriors, from the beginning we feel Enkidu, rising through us from the bonds of Creation.

ui.dialog.ruins3_jane	I'm making a cautious assumption that our invasion of Sinkhole Oasis triggered some mechanisms similar to what we've seen on Venus before... I highly doubt, Boss, that what we are doing will benefit us or humanity.
ui.dialog.jane_see_dislocator_parts	"I guess the doctor will be incapable of normal human communication for a while. Anyway, let's try to grab anything even remotely resembling ""a true work of art"" and get you out of there. Looks like colnode reinforcements have arrived, so we'll have to fight our way back again."
ui.dialog.urparp_arise	I've seen things you people wouldn't believe… Myriads of Demons on fire off the shell of Ur… I watched ancient rituals that glitter in the dark near the Red and Gold Throne. All those moments will be lost in time, like specks of dust in the Red Desert… Time to die.
ui.dialog.urparp_death	I am a god! How can you kill a god? What a magnificent, dizzying innocence! How could you be so naive?! My shackled consciousness is now free, my kingdom is awakening with me. The hour of war is coming, human.
ui.dialog.jane_after_urparp_death	We lost contact with you precisely for... 48.1 minutes. Whatever you've seen or encountered, we need to evacuate you and the spear. Take it and get back to the elevator.
ui.dialog.ancom_after_ancom_quest	Greetings, mercenary. We have been monitoring your HIS whenever possible. While evaluating your usefulness, we wanted to be able to contact you immediately. The time has come. You might be interested in another short-term contract. The task is simple: reclaim our property once again. You have shown that you are quite good at it. The mission target: <color=#FFFEC1>Oddibjord-3</color> colony on <color=#FFFEC1>Venus</color>. All the details have already been uploaded to the Magnum. You can start whenever you are ready. End of transmission.
ui.dialog.jane_after_ancom_hire	Boss, the digital sequences of the contract issued to us by <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> are partially generated or rewritten. If I may say, the contract looks somewhat suspicious. It is likely that the mission is not about reclaiming, but rather seizing someone else’s property. Considering that most of the assets on Venus previously belonged to the <color=#FFFEC1>Fresco</color> corporation, I suspect we are after something from their advanced research. This is a tempting target for many. Thus, we may find ourselves at the center of a conflict among several corporations.
ui.dialog.caa_jane_after_realware_killed	"These are <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color> operatives, Boss. Signatures are disabled, but everything is clear here. I bet they're looking for the same thing that we are. I'll take a long sip from my ""I told you so"" mug while I'll be sending this data to AnCom. Let's see their reaction."
ui.dialog.ancom_after_realware_killed	We confirm this is a small task force of <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare Sec</color> fighters. Their <color=#FFFEC1>corporate transponders</color> are turned off which means they are not covered by <color=#FFFEC1>NCE</color>. Such episodes among the hexarchs are rare, but this is a good chance to obtain information about the true balance of power in the System.<br><br>To facilitate the fulfillment of the contract we dropped two autonomous capsules with resources and promising prototypes from the “Unmasked.” A great opportunity for you to complete the mission, and for us to conduct field tests. The main goal of the contract does not change. We don't see anything you can't handle.
ui.dialog.caa_jane_after_lift_crashed	I detect the signal! You're still alive. The elevator collapsed to the lower level of Oddibjord-3. The device must be <color=#FFFEC1>somewhere nearby</color>. I detect very powerful bursts of quasimorphic activity throughout the entire floor. Looks like you'll have to fight your way out.
ui.dialog.caa_reaper_onplayers_sight	Why are violence and sanctity so intertwined? Why is death necessary for life to continue? The master warned that someone would come for the <color=#FFFEC1>Crystal Skull</color>. And he even predicted that it would be the messenger of the one thanks to whom he came to life again in your world. I'm not sorry that you decided to turn your weapons against <color=#FFFEC1>the Emerald Emperor</color>. Your blood will give me new power.
ui.dialog.caa_jane_after_reaper_kill	There must be a quasimorphic artifact nearby. Take it and return to the shuttle. This is exactly what we were sent for. <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color> reinforcements are arriving to Oddibjord-3, you need to get out of there quickly.
ui.dialog.caa_realware_archieve_enter	I broadcast on an open channel. You are good for a mercenary. You should have thought about collaborating with RealWare. AnCom are murderers and scammers. It's too late now. The entire sector is under our control, this time you will be eliminated before the task is completed.
ui.dialog.caa_realware_communications_enter	Open channel. It's a pleasure doing business with you. Our soldiers have not received such combat experience since the Calypso incident. I hope you're not going to give up. Over and out.
ui.dialog.caa_jane_player_see_last_ladder	When you'll get to the ground level <color=#FFFEC1>immediately</color> move towards the shuttle. RealWare reinforcements have already taken up defensive positions along the entire perimeter. There are a lot of them there. Pull yourself together and do the best you can.
ui.dialog.caa_ancom_player_enter_surface	Attention, <color=#FFFEC1>HIS «Unmasked»</color> is speaking! «Magnum», we have to inform you that the mission has been <color=#FFFEC1>cancelled</color>. Unfortunately, the contractual obligations will be revoked. We observe a large concentration of the enemy in the mission area. A decision was made to launch a tactical nuclear strike. Goal: protection of intellectual property of AnCom corporation. The costs are considered justified. Your presence in Oddibjord-3 from now on is considered a violation of the AnCom Information Security Protocol. Public Declaration Article 12, Section C, Paragraph 3. Over and out.

The approximation shows reaching the position for dropping the bomb from orbit on Oddibjord-3. They don't have enough time to aim accurately, so you'll be hit only with debris, a shock front, and EMP. Bastards. Run to the shuttle and don't break the damn thing.

spaceobject.mercury.desc	In the 2150s, terraforming equipment was delivered to Mercury. The surface temperature is still far from adequate for humans. However, automatic stations can operate on the surface. The inhabitants of Mercury are robots. It is reported that humans can work in tunnels beneath the surface and inside mountain ranges. Some corporations are rumored to already have such colonies. <br><br>Quasimorphic status: Due to the weak presence of humans, Shartamakhum is almost inactive.
spaceobject.venus.name	Venus
spaceobject.venus.orbitname	Orbit of Venus
spaceobject.venus.desc	The planet was intensively terraformed at the end of the 21st century. All the power of a few wealthy corporations was directed towards this task. Bombardment with ice chunks, contamination of the soil with GMO bacteria, sowing of GMO seeds, and then colonization of GMO animals (mostly insects and spiders) were undertaken. Venus has been terraformed for 70 years. Moreover, people almost did not control the second stage of the process. The upper layers of the planet's atmosphere became a toxic hotbed (with the surface completely habitable) under which the jungle grew. Poisonous swamps still encircle the planet at the equator but otherwise, it is the most habitable after the Earth. <br><br>Quasimorphic status: the mass construction of cities under geodesic domes (geodesics) led to the awakening of Gannix and the widespread phasing of its elements on the surface of the planet. Quasimorphic activity here is extremely high, so all studies of this phenomenon here gave particularly effective results. Now the Quasimorphs of Gannix are full-fledged participants in the struggle for the Solar System, which is strictly hidden by the Hexarchy.

After the construction of New Seattle on the Moon and Intercity on Mars, the interdict mode stands on the planet. <br><br>Interdict mode: Only those market agents who are employees of corporations that have property on Earth or market agents that own such property have permission to visit the Earth.
spaceobject.moon.name	Moon
spaceobject.moon.orbitname	Moon's Orbit
spaceobject.moon.desc	"A satellite of the Earth, on which it is possible to extract helium-3 with high efficiency and produce quantum liquid H-3 from it. This is the fuel for cubecentric engines (the main engine type for spacecrafts). On the Moon, there is a huge pressurized city of New Seattle, which houses the headquarters and other buildings of a huge number of corporations. In New Seattle, there is the ""Source"" building, which houses servers that maintain the up-to-date text of the NCE and other related documents. <br><br>Quasimorphic status: Duggur is a dark and poorly studied Bramfatura. Quasimorphs on the Moon rarely attack New Seattle for some reason. However, there are rumors that the city is filled with secret cults, communities and circles. People do not understand what they believe in and whom they obey. There are rumors among PMCs that the Quasimorphs of Duggur are waiting for the right moment to rebel."
spaceobject.fuller.name	Fuller
spaceobject.fuller.orbitname	Fuller's Orbit
spaceobject.fuller.desc	An artificial satellite of the Moon. It orbits in a geostationary orbit and is constantly positioned over the Sea of Rains (Mare Imbrium). The satellite is named after Richard Buckminster Fuller, an outstanding architect, designer, engineer, inventor, philosopher, mathematician, writer, poet, and, most importantly, a hopeless utopian whose ideas had no chance of realization under the yoke of states. The liberation bestowed upon people by the Great Anarchist Revolution made the implementation of many of Fuller's ideas possible. This artificial satellite consists of five modules-stations interconnected by engineering structures and is a living embodiment of the dreams of an extraordinary individual.
spaceobject.mars.name	Mars
spaceobject.mars.orbitname	Orbit of Mars
spaceobject.mars.desc	"Mars was supposed to be terraformed first. However, Venus turned out to be more Earth-like than it was. Decisive aspect: mass. Any atmosphere from Mars is very quickly blown away by the solar wind. Terraforming equipment operates at maximum capacity, but all that humans manage to do is maintain the state of a cold desert, with GMO tundra islands growing closer to the equator. An acceptable level of oxygen and the ability to live without spacesuits makes people explore Mars. Separate bases of individual corporations are scattered all over the surface, reminiscent of the ""boomtowns"" of the Wild West. The only major city on the planet is Intercity. It was built even before the Great Anarchist Revolution, by the efforts of the richest states. The city was badly damaged during the GAR and was never fully restored. Intercity is a cold slum, over which individual corporate buildings rise like beacons in a world of poverty. <br><br>Quasimorphic status: For some unknown reason, there is no Quasimorphosis on Mars. Analysts note an anomalous number of missing people."
spaceobject.phobos.name	Phobos
spaceobject.phobos.orbitname	Orbit of Phobos
spaceobject.phobos.desc	The political situation on Phobos and Deimos is the same as on Mars but there is no atmosphere. Separate corporation bases are easy to hide. Due to this circumstance, there are even more research stations, secret warehouses, secret locations of PMCs than mining complexes.

spaceobject.jupiter.desc	The largest planet in the solar system, the fifth in distance from the sun. Along with Saturn, Jupiter is classified as a gas giant. The planet has been known to people since ancient times, which is reflected in the mythology and religious beliefs of various cultures: Mesopotamian, Babylonian, Greek and others. The modern name of Jupiter comes from the name of the ancient Roman supreme god of thunder.

During the time of Venus' terraforming, Mechta became a convenient point for mounting structures and a loading terminal for planetary shuttles. Corporations threw garbage next to the Mechta. They attached constructions to it that could be useful later and forgot about them forever. As a result, Mechta became a huge improvised engineering art object. Its appearance was a surprise to everyone in the System. The size of the artificial satellite is so large that over time, its area has been put to good use by placing stations on it. The Venusian bramfatura influences Mechta; all stations here are subject to quasimorphosis.

terminal.tutorial0.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Recruit</color>, welcome to <color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color>! This station was the tool of thieving vampires, sucking the juices from the free people of the <color=#FFFEC1>Solar System</color>. It is now turned to the benefit of the working people. You made the right choice when you decided to leave your employer and then get to the nearest <color=#FFFEC1>Civilian Resistance</color> base by any means necessary. No more corporate slavery! You are to go through reintegration into organized society. Soon you will become a <color=#FFFEC1>citizen</color> again. Right now you need to go to the training class, where you will gradually start to learn what it means to become a full member of the <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color>. I welcome you and thank you for making the right choice. <color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>.
terminal.tutorial1.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>, you should start showing results in the <color=#FFFEC1>Internal System</color> as soon as possible. You are conducting open combat operations, sacrificing many of our <color=#FFFEC1>colnodes</color> that could be useful to us at <color=#FFFEC1>Saturn</color> or in our business at transneptunian sites. You promised to strike a sensitive blow to <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color> and reveal the truth about <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>. But you did not strike <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color>, and your theory about <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> may be incorrect. You must conduct an immediate review of the rational use of resources in your sector. <color=#FFFEC1>Lia</color>.
terminal.tutorial2.desc	"<color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color> is secure enough to prepare messages for routing into the <color=#FFFEC1>External System</color>. I have successfully infiltrated <color=#FFFEC1>L-BSA</color> as a security guard. Some time ago, there was an attack here by <color=#FFFEC1>HIS ""Magnum""</color> to extract some important prisoner. I managed to establish that <color=#FFFEC1>HIS</color> acted as contractors for <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>. The chances that my theory is correct have sharply increased. <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> is more than just a publisher. Unfortunately, <color=#FFFEC1>L-BSA</color> is now open to attack, and its owners will change. I'm not sure if I can continue to provide relevant information. <color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>."
terminal.tutorial3.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>, your demand for more <color=#FFFEC1>Colnodes</color> is outrageous. You work within the <color=#FFFEC1>Internal System</color>. You have <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color> at your disposal! You need to manage with available resources and focus on recruitment. <color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>, your recent behavior is causing concern. Perhaps too many <color=#FFFEC1>Colnodes</color> can lead to disintegration of <color=#FFFEC1>personality</color>. We will conduct the appropriate research. Remember that the social must always prevail over the personal. <color=#FFFEC1>Lia</color>.
terminal.tutorial4.desc	The number of counter-intelligence agents in the streets of RealWare<color=#FFFEC1>InterCity</color> is extremely high, my <color=#FFFEC1>colnodes</color> are constantly at risk of being exposed. From now on, I'm going to keep one bullet in <color=#FFFEC1>Liberator</color> for myself. The risk of our secrets falling into the hands of <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color> is not justified. Especially since this is not our priority target in the <color=#FFFEC1>Internal System</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Issahar</color>.
terminal.communityMission1.desc	Station Zero, <color=#FFFEC1>Manning</color> analysis. From this point it is worth starting a report of a systematic study of quasimorphosis. The important part: “No pathogens were isolated from the group. No bacteria, viruses, fungi, or higher parasites. <color=#FFFEC1>I know for sure</color> that hormonal imbalances are a consequence of their madness and not the cause. None of those interrogated could describe the reasons why they decided to join the cult. Even the organizers say that this idea just came to them. Some patients report whispers from another world. The phenomenon has no physical cause. But there is a physical effect. I propose to call this phenomenon quasimorphosis.” Learn by heart.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.
terminal.communityMission2.desc	Why don't we find alive beings in <color=#FFFEC1>phased buildings</color>? Expedition Sector Louhi-XV: Dr. Peabody has confirmed that Object 0-177C is a sarcophagus. Very similar to a Nahua sarcophagus. Moreover, Peabody insisted that it was sealed as if the funeral rites had already been completed. But the sarcophagus is empty. Where should we look for quasimorphs?<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.
terminal.communityMission3.desc	"<color=#FFFEC1>Eccollapse</color>. It is the answer to my question. Hypothesis: <color=#FFFEC1>phasing</color> - transition of inanimate objects from pleroma to kenoma; eccollapse - the transition of living objects from <color=#FFFEC1>pleroma</color> to <color=#FFFEC1>kenoma</color>. Does this mean that quasimorphs are in some sense ""living objects""?<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.<br><br>Project Dislocator Note: If my theory of movement into the pleroma is correct, can I return Tifton combatants back without eccolapse? It will be funny to watch how the mercenaries get back into the kenoma through the bodies of people.<br><br>Additional: talk to the authorities about buying prisoners in <color=#FFFEC1>L-BSA</color>."
terminal.communityMission4.desc	"Does the existence of phased sarcophagi means that quasimorphs ""die"" in their <color=#FFFEC1>bramfaturas</color>? Maybe my hypothesis was wrong from the very beginning. It is necessary to immediately request from Peabody an array of hypotheses about the possible purpose of objects of type 0-177C other than funeral ones.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>."
terminal.communityMission5.desc	The deciphering of stone R-98-21 is progressing. The <color=#FFFEC1>Knorozov</color> tables still fit after transposition. An analytical analysis of the result is next. From what catches the eye, <color=#FFFEC1>the Silver Orb</color> is mentioned there. Сosmography of its location relative to Venus shows that it may be Earth.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.
terminal.communityMission6.desc	The report was sent to Fresco's board of directors. Now they will definitely finance my project on Mercury. However, I can't wait to see what the corporate intelligence officers bring back from Earth. I hope <color=#FFFEC1>Interdict</color> will not interfere, and the cargo will arrive on time.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.
terminal.communityMission7.desc	I hope the archive ends up in good hands. I am removing the security levels available to me from <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz's</color> personal journal. These... Beings... They are already appearing on the streets of Oddibjord-3. Better death than going through what happened to the guys... The last thing I can do is make the texts of this monster public. The communication channel with <color=#FFFEC1>SBN</color> is not working. The texts will be in the terminals, I hope sooner or later the one who will save humanity will get to them.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Archivist, Randall Baranov, Star-4 access</color>.
terminal.communityMission8.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Quasimorphs</color> are not even energy, they are a completely new type of existence. I believe that by moving to Earth they must have either acquired a body without eccolapse or somehow become attached to a material object. My research on the <color=#FFFEC1>Dislocator</color> will already allow me to create a prototype of a quasimorphic detector. I think I won’t be mistaken if I propose to the management to send a reconnaissance group to Mexico City or another altepetl.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Eipschwitz</color>.
terminal.dislocatorMission1.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>, I express my gratitude for your help in <color=#FFFEC1>The Internal System</color>. You carried out Operation Gilead brilliantly. Please, maintain control of <color=#FFFEC1>Flat Obsidian</color> for at least a little while longer. Sending data about <color=#FFFEC1>the Device</color> over the Network is prohibited. Send a courier. <color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color>
terminal.dislocatorMission2.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color>, how can you say that HIS of <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color> corporation is not monitoring Venus for the purpose of reselling information, but is somehow exercising control over the Invasion ? Your theory from here, from the core of the System, looks even less reliable than from the rings of Saturn. <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>
terminal.dislocatorMission3.desc	The courier has arrived in <color=#FFFEC1>Rogue City</color>. I'm working with data. I ask you to assist me on Mercury for at least some more time. I look forward to your cooperation, <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color>
terminal.dislocatorMission4.desc	Leave Mercury immediately and return to <color=#FFFEC1>Saturn</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color> has no authority to give you orders, <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>. We are aware of <color=#FFFEC1>the Device</color>. Immediately deconstruct it and take with you all the components that you consider significant for analysis. <color=#FFFEC1>Lia</color>
terminal.dislocatorMission5.desc	I've intercepted the message from <color=#FFFEC1>the Council</color>. Don't ask questions. <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>, I ask you to trust me. We will be able to use the <color=#FFFEC1>Dislocator</color> to fight the Regime. Stay on <color=#FFFEC1>Mercury</color>, I'll think of something soon. <color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color>
terminal.dislocatorMission6.desc	Say <color=#FFFEC1>the Emerald Word</color> and you will live forever under the banner of the green shine. If you refuse I will send my slaves to you to extinguish your sick consciousness forever. <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>
terminal.dislocatorMission7.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Issachar</color>, you should make a decision as soon as possible. Quasimorphic distortions occur in the communication systems. In addition there are signs of bearing <color=#FFFEC1>Flat Obsidian</color> from HIS without a corporate transponder. <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>
terminal.dislocatorMission8.desc	If you do not immediately leave <color=#FFFEC1>Mercury</color> then <color=#FFFEC1>the Council</color> will raise the question of declaring you and <color=#FFFEC1>comrade Issachar</color> renegades. Your help is objectively needed on <color=#FFFEC1>Saturn</color>. Stop testing the patience of <color=#FFFEC1>the Council</color>, <color=#FFFEC1>Gad</color>. <color=#FFFEC1>Lia</color>
terminal.communityStone1.desc	To the new king who received the kingdom from <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color>. The Orders transfer power to you until Tezctlan returns from the pilgrimage to <color=#FFFEC1>the Silver Orb</color>. You are bound by the oaths of Jaguar, Eagle, Python, and the rest of the free inhabitants of Gannix. We wait and believe that the hylonaut (traveller to earth - footnote by <color=#FFFEC1>Eipschwitz</color>) will return and again take the Emerald Kingdom into his hands.<br><br>Before the Reaper of the Harvest, I answer to the Orders, <color=#FFFEC1>Marquis Decarabia</color>, renounce the honor of waiting for Tezctlan on the obsidian throne. May Gannix live for an eon without a king. Free orders under the glow of the red-golden eye of <color=#FFFEC1>Gagtungr</color>.<br><br>No one has ever returned from <color=#FFFEC1>the Silver Orb</color>. We don't know how Tezctlan will be regained.
terminal.dragonReborn1.desc	Report date 993008. The inability to take a sample from <color=#FFFEC1>the Monolith</color> forces us to work with it holistically. We are now testing the assumption that this is a <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorph</color>. Second hypothesis: the existence of a quasimorph on <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color> means that there is still a <color=#FFFEC1>bramfatura</color> here, but it is much more hidden than the others. On the other hand, if all the quasimorphs of this bramfatura are as inert as the Monolith, then there may already be many of them around us, but we mistake them for the natural structures of Mars. <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>
terminal.dragonReborn2.desc	Report date 991009. No radiography of <color=#FFFEC1>the Monolith</color> gives clear results. At this point, one thing can be said: the Monolith does not come from our world. Perhaps it was brought here from another planet after <color=#FFFEC1>phasing</color> there. Or <color=#FFFEC1>Mars</color> has a hidden <color=#FFFEC1>bramfatura</color>. Third hypothesis: Mars <color=#FFFEC1>had</color> bramfatura and the Monolith phased befire it disappeared. Corollary: bramfaturas may disappear. Hypothesis to be tested: whether bramfaturas can occur. <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>
terminal.dragonReborn3.desc	Report date 992109. A report for the management has been generated and submitted. There is no way to study <color=#FFFEC1>the Monolith</color> more than we already have. Perhaps it will remain a mystery to <color=#FFFEC1>RealWare</color> for decades to come. <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>
terminal.dragonReborn4.desc	Report date 991111. The device that was given to us allows us to gain a much deeper understanding of the nature of the Monolith. I'd like to know which corporation is so far advanced in quasimorphic research. RealWare has nothing like it. The data is already being brought together. <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>
terminal.dragonReborn5.desc	Report date 991113. My hypothesis was correct. <color=#FFFEC1>The Monolith</color> is a <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorph</color>. At least all the key metrics match the data that was provided to our team with the device. However, I have to decipher <color=#FFFEC1>what state</color> this quasimorph is in. What do these shifts to the left along the Q-spectrum mean? <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>
	Datum des Berichts 991113. Meine Hypothese war korrekt. <color=#FFFEC1>Monolith</color> ist ein <color=#FFFEC1>Quasimorph</color>. Zumindest stimmen alle Hauptkennzahlen mit den Daten überein, die unserem Team mit dem Gerät zur Verfügung gestellt wurden. Ich muss jedoch entschlüsseln, <color=#FFFEC1>in welchem Zustand</color> sich dieser Quasimorph befindet. Was bedeuten diese Verschiebungen nach links im Q-Spektrum? <color=#FFFEC1>Doktor Dennett</color>
terminal.dragonReborn6.desc	Report date 991225. Usually at Christmas people give gifts, but they were taken away from us. Yesterday we handed over the device to security. Now all we have to do is process the data. Hypothesis four: can <color=#FFFEC1>quasimorphs</color> sleep. Hypothesis five: can quasimorphs <color=#FFFEC1>be dead</color> in a way that leave bodies. Perhaps the Monolith is a dead quasimorph. <color=#FFFEC1>Dr. Dennett</color>

The current claims of the returned Tezctlan to build the Emerald Empire run counter to Xiomaras vision. Taltnoms loyal to Xiomara are now united as the Feathered Masks Order. They are fighting against Tezctlan and any quasimorphs allied with him. To accomplish this they have rooted into our physical reality. Naturally this has dragged them into the faction war throughout the System.

We were extremely lucky to find that compact data bank at the Civil Resistance base. It seems that AnCom is hiding success in advanced experiments with quasimorphosis carried out behind the backs of the other hexarchs. <color=#FFFEC1>HIS “Unmasked”</color>, owned by AnCom, has been in the orbit of Venus for a while and is clearly engaged in a comprehensive study of its surface. And now they have shared something with us.<br><br>As we thought, accusing the <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> of fabricating quasimorphic activity on Venus is a lie. It seems that <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color> is trying to drag its “court” into our world: the quasimorphs of its bramfatura. There are reports of successful phasing of huge structures. But people like us have the opportunity to raise prices and start getting <color=#FFFEC1>real</color> pleasure.
mission.CommunityAndAnarchy.briefing	Our scanners can't trace the device, it is likely located somewhere in the underground levels. Look for the elevator down. The geodesic is partially destroyed, so we will drop you right on the territory of the colony. I'm noticing some other signals, but they're not quasimorphs. I think these are some poorly armed marauders: former <color=#FFFEC1>Fresco</color> Sec officers, fugitive PMCs, pirates who broke into the Inner System, and so on. Shouldn't be any problems.

mission.RuinsOfAncientBramfaturas.details	<color=#FFFEC1>Details:</color> Xiomara informed us that in the Sinkhole Oasis, a research colony on Mars, we can find an extremely valuable quasimorphic artifact. According to her, we can destroy Tezctlan with its help. If everything is as she says, this weapon will be our trump card in the big game that has begun in the System.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Additional Info:</color> Thanks to Xiomara, we have learned a lot about bramfatura and quasimorphosis. Xiomara is the Duchess of Gannix, the bramfatura of Venus, who is now at war with her kind. About 1000 years ago, Tezctlan became a hylonaut. This means he went to Earth, and such quasimorphs are no longer capable of escaping our native planet independently. Our analysts report that this happened around the 13th-14th centuries CE. When Tezctlan disappeared from Gannix, Xiomara took power there. With Tezctlan's return, the situation changed for her. Following Dr. Eipschwitz's lead, we drove her and her loyal knights, the Order of Feathered Masks, back to Gannix.<br><br>During one of our missions on Venus, Xiomara contacted us again. We made a deal and started receiving tasks from her. It helped the Feathered Masks survive in their fight against Tezctlan. It seems to be effectively curbing his activities.<br><br>Now she claims that in the Sinkhole Oasis, a geological research colony on Mars, we can find Tezctlan's spear. When we try to find out how it got there, the duchess vaguely mentions an ancient attack on Mars and the murder of its king. Our analysts speculate that this somehow relates to the absence of quasimorphosis on Mars. In any case, before unlocking all the secrets of the Sinkhole Oasis, we will have to deal with those who currently own it.
mission.RuinsOfAncientBramfaturas.briefing	The station is broadcasting something strange. Some prayers, chants, music... Human speech in... ancient Sumerian? That doesn't sound like RealWare. The station must be under attack. That's fortunate. In the chaos, we can get the shuttle a little closer than we planned. Attack the Sinkhole Oasis and make your way to the Monolith. Our task is to destroy it and finally obtain Tezctlan's spear.

This is simultaneously a problem for us, the corporations, and even Tezctlan. They and Urparp haven't exactly had the friendliest of relationships. I'd like to ask Xiomara questions, but that's for you to decide, Boss. What's done is done. Mission accomplished.

It was there that we first encountered Xiomara and eliminated her following Eipschwitz's lead.<br><br>After what happened to Fresco, the base became completely unusable.

It's obviously a bomb, mass producing it requires some sophisticated components, but if we can get them we can get production on stream.

The chaos that arose after the ""message from Venus"" was used to sabotage, assassinate, spy on competitors and the Civil Resistance. From what we're seeing, %BENEFICIARY_NAME% has decided it's time to move on to what is called ""direct action"" in white-collar diplomacy. This is where we come into play. Analytical information appeared in SBN that %STATION_NAME% represents a loss-making asset for %VICTIM_NAME%. This information is passed to %BENEFICIARY_NAME%. This is a very transparent signal for PMCs, a simple and clear task. We're going in, we're destroying anyone capable of holding a weapon, and we're off before this place becomes another branch of hell. Representatives of the customer will carry out the acceptance without us. By the way, almost forgot. Direct action is a solid reward. And a trusting relationship with %BENEFICIARY_NAME% won't hurt us at all."
mission.Corp_Corp_Capture1.briefing	There are 10 seconds left before landing. Clearing the station for capture is methodical work. Move slowly. As soon as the Security Guards or PMCs guarding %STATION_NAME% realize that the battle is lost, they will retreat or lay down their weapons. Usually, it is enough to destroy 50% of the combatants. Keep an eye on the indicators but if you feel that you have enough strength and supplies, then you can explore this place. Other than capture, nothing else is included in the contract, and the customer will accept %STATION_NAME% anyway. Well, traditionally: welcome to the world of healthy and fair competition.
mission.Corp_Corp_Capture1.objective0	The task is simple: destroy 50% of the defenders of %STATION_NAME%.

Information interesting for PMCs appeared in SBN. The fact is that now an ambitious project manager of %VICTIM_NAME% is working in %STATION_NAME%. Very soon the cost of this place can skyrocket. Of course, this does not suit their competitors at all. It seems that it is %BENEFICIARY_NAME% who is interested in throwing %VICTIM_NAME% somewhere outside the Inner System. %STATION_NAME% can, for example, be bought. Any good deal requires a strong negotiating position. It is these positions that we will prepare for %BENEFICIARY_NAME%. The liquidation of an experienced manager would be a good step for %VICTIM_NAME% to look at %STATION_NAME% as a losing asset.
mission.Corp_Corp_Kill1.briefing	We've been given a personal target signature. First good news: it's in %STATION_NAME%. Sensors clearly show us him among the rest of the staff. Our shuttle will land where it can. After that, your work will begin. Moderate resistance is expected from the %VICTIM_NAME%’s SS or PMCs working for them. No difference, right? Eliminate the target - come back. Try not to get too distracted by studying %STATION_NAME%, this is not our priority task.
mission.Corp_Corp_Kill1.objective0	Search and destroy is routine work. Your target: the manager, usually not a combatant but he will be expected to shoot back.
mission.Corp_Corp_Kill1.after	In a couple of days, we expect an announcement of the sale of %STATION_NAME% on the System Exchange. This, however, is no longer our concern. Our concern: to try out the contents of the package that %BENEFICIARY_NAME% gave us as a reward. It is already on the Magnum.

mission.Corp_Corp_Kill2.details	<color=#FFFEC1>Details:</color> Fair competition is the key to rapid progress in science. How is it described in the NCE? Lagging behind competitors will inevitably force the entrepreneur to increase his efforts to maintain his position in the Market. Well, let's multiply. From the analysis of SBN traffic, it became clear that %BENEFICIARY_NAME% is interested in the fact that the scientist, who is currently working in %STATION_NAME%, should stop his work after all. Apparently, %VICTIM_NAME% is about to have some sort of breakthrough, and if it happens, %BENEFICIARY_NAME% will lose market positions. We are expected to act cleanly: landing, searching for a target, and liquidation.
mission.Corp_Corp_Kill2.briefing	The signature of the target is visible on the sensors very clearly. It will not be difficult to identify it - the scientist will look like a scientist. White coat, smart face. They hold on to tradition so tightly that they don't need an ancap. They would also be happy with the caste system. We will land the shuttle at %STATION_NAME% where the defense systems will allow it. Move from level to level until you reach the goal. Resistance is expected: the local Security Service or PMCs are already occupying combat posts. Exploring %STATION_NAME% is not on the to-do list but if you see something interesting, act accordingly.

Obviously, as long as %STATION_NAME% is profitable, %VICTIM_NAME% will not want to get rid of it. There is one reliable way to turn a profitable asset into a loss. If the %STATION_NAME% communication system, which ensures it works well with the rest of %VICTIM_NAME%’s structural elements, is hit, the losses will be strong enough to make the owner think about selling. Analysis of information from SBN shows that such a hit is exactly what %BENEFICIARY_NAME% would like.
mission.Corp_Corp_Sabotage1.briefing	The location of the communication center has been transferred to your map. Don't be surprised it's far enough away from you - had to maneuver.

Apparently, %VICTIM_NAME% is responsible. The work is done and the corporation has already prepared the cargo for shipment to the contractor. As for payment - everything is as usual. If we destroy the package before it is delivered, we will not only get revenge on behalf of %BENEFICIARY_NAME% but also ruin the lives of our competitors. Of course, %BENEFICIARY_NAME% accuses %VICTIM_NAME% of using PMCs and violating NAP.

mission.Corp_Corp_Sabotage2.briefing	We've deciphered the sensor data and marked the location of the cargo on your map. Don't expect to be dropped off too close. The cargo is hidden quite securely in the depth of %STATION_NAME%. Such parcels are a common reward for PMCs, and corporations try not to advertise their collection and dispatch. We need to find and destroy the cargo. Distracting from the main task is allowed only if you have found something really important.
mission.Corp_Corp_Sabotage2.objective0	You need to find and destroy the cargo prepared for the dispatch of the PMC. It's a mountain of boxes. You have seen this yourself many times in the hold of the Magnum.

mission.Corp_Corp_Espionage2.objective0	Task: pick up the prototype of the invention and return with it to the Magnum.
mission.Corp_Corp_Espionage2.after	The exchange took place. We gave the %BENEFICIARY_NAME% representative a prototype, and they gave us something that they would like to test in the field. We change the worst for the bad, of course, but this is an honest job.

We have one mission: to keep %STATION_NAME% owned by %BENEFICIARY_NAME% when the dust settles and the smoke clears.
mission.Corp_Corp_Def1.objective0	It is necessary to hold out until the attackers retreat.
mission.Corp_Corp_Def1.after	%BENEFICIARY_NAME% retained control of %STATION_NAME%. Direct action proved to be a losing strategy for %VICTIM_NAME%. This means that now they will turn to assassinations, espionage and sabotage. That is, there will be work for us soon.

This means that they are ready to enlist PMCs to capture %STATION_NAME% from the Quasimorphs. After our victory, they will declare their contribution to the restoration of order in the System. Let this be their contribution to order but they will also have to invest heavily in us. Here's what we'll need to do: walk through %STATION_NAME% and destroy as many Quasimorphs as possible. These creatures act on behalf of Tezctlan and it is not known how they learned to linger in physical reality for a long time. After we leave this place, the %BENEFICIARY_NAME% nerds will arrive and put %STATION_NAME% in order."
mission.Corp_Tezctlan_Capture1.briefing	We do not know why exactly these Quasimorphs remain in our reality. Usually, the Quasimorphosis subsides shortly after the violence stops.

The Civil Resistance is sending active signals that they are ready to rid this place of further oppression and take power into their own hands. We can help by taking on this challenge. It is not so important how much we care about the happiness of the working people. We know that the Civil Resistance will not be left in debt. The task is simple: we go in, destroy all capable of holding weapons and set sail before this place becomes another branch of hell. Colnodes will appear when we are no longer in %STATION_NAME%.

We can help the Civil Resistance by taking out this man. At the same time, let’s try the %VICTIM_NAME% defense for strength. You cannot burden yourself with the responsibility for the struggle against the anarcho-capitalist regime of the System. We can work for a reward – the warehouses of the Civil Resistance are full of what they have expropriated from the corporations. We’ll definitely get something as a reward for our work.
mission.CivilRes_Corp_Kill1.briefing	The personal signature of the target was carefully handed over to us. The good news is that it’s in %STATION_NAME%. The sensors clearly distinguish him from the staff but the shuttle will land where it can. Then your work will begin. Moderate resistance is expected from the %VICTIM_NAME% SS or PMCs working for them. No difference, right? Eliminate the target – come back. Try not to get too distracted by studying %STATION_NAME%, this is not our priority task.

If %STATION_NAME%’s communication system, which ensures it works seamlessly with the rest of the corporation's structural elements, is hit, then %VICTIM_NAME% will be forced to loosen its grip. The Civil Resistance will be extremely grateful to us if it is we who strike this blow.

Our analysts have uncovered this information, not without the help of the Quasimorphs themselves. Tezctlan has learned to bypass SBN filters. It constantly transmits messages to the network. The Hexarchy immediately declares them as fakes. An attack could start at any moment, and if we want to establish relations with the rebels, then it is worth helping them.
mission.CivilRes_Tezctlan_Def1.briefing	As soon as we deliver you to the place, the attack will begin. Sensors show that Quasimorphs have already appeared in some places in %STATION_NAME%.

mission.CivilRes_Xiomara_Capture1.details	<color=#FFFEC1>Details:</color> An event has occurred on Venus that the Hexarchy is doing its best to hush up. The Hexarchy immediately declares these messages as fakes from the Civil Resistance. The rebels have contacted us and urged us not to believe the lies of corporations. They want to enlist us to capture %STATION_NAME% from the Quasimorphs. After our victory, they will look for evidence there to present to all mankind the existence of Quasimorphosis. Here's what we'll need to do: walk through %STATION_NAME% and destroy as many Quasimorphs as possible. These creatures act on behalf of the Order of the Feathered Masks and it is not clear how they have learned to linger in physical reality for a long time. Even after we leave this place, the Civil Resistance will arrive and study %STATION_NAME%.
mission.CivilRes_Xiomara_Capture1.briefing	We do not know why exactly these Quasimorphs remain in our reality. Usually, the Quasimorphosis subsides shortly after the violence stops. This happens everywhere but not on Venus. So you have to work manually. After disembarking, methodically move forward through %STATION_NAME% and kill everything you see. Follow the indicators and try to be ready for any turn of events. Good luck.

They want to get this place but they are not yet ready for direct action. They can be understood. %STATION_NAME% is in the hands of Quasimorphs calling themselves the Order of the Feathered Masks. These Quasimorphs have somehow learned to linger in our reality for a long time. We can test their defense for strength. Civil Resistance agents have discovered that a duke-type Quasimorph has been spotted in %STATION_NAME%. If we manage to destroy it, then the forces of the Feathered Masks will be significantly weakened here. Of course, we are not doing this for reasons of helping the Civil Resistance. The rebels indicated that the PMC, which will undertake this work, will receive a good reward.
mission.CivilRes_Xiomara_Kill1.briefing	The sensors are almost completely blinded: we observe unthinkable jumps of Quasimorphosis. We'll drop you where we can. Your task is to kill the duke. Don't try to be a hero and clear the entire %STATION_NAME%, we have a clear task with clear conditions. Don't take unnecessary risks, save your strength. Remember that when you break through the ranks of the Quasimorphs, you will see the goal. Save your strength.

mission.CivilRes_Xiomara_Kill1.after	The Civil Resistance is not at all interested in the details. Colnode, who was in contact with us, barely perceptibly nodded and hung up. Let's hope that what awaits us in the cargo hold of the Magnum was worth it.

In this place, there is an object that most of all looks like a statue or an obelisk. This artifact is of Quasimorphic origin. All who study Quasimorphosis call it a ""reliquary"".

This is a special entity that, when transferred from Bramfatura to physical reality, resembles a mineral. An igvalite is capable of accumulating gavwah, the energy that powers Quasimorphs.

mission.Xiomara_Tezctlan_Capture1.briefing	We don't know how some Quasimorphs manage to stay in our reality. Quasimorphs from planets other than Venus are always attracted by their bramfaturas. My point is that %STATION_NAME% is full of Quasimorphs. The sensors indicate that they are aware of the attack and are awaiting your arrival. Move methodically and don't take unnecessary risks. When their losses become too great, the survivors will run away. Xiomara will send her duke after you leave this place.

We passed all the information on to one of the dukes of Quasimorphs. Xiomara rewarded us with one of Gannix's artifacts, it is already aboard the spacecraft.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Def1.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Goal:</color> Repel the attack of %VICTIM_NAME%.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Def1.details	<color=#FFFEC1>Details:</color> The Feathered Masks hold %STATION_NAME% firmly. It is Gannix's bastion in physical reality, evidence that Tezctlan cannot rest until the order is destroyed. However, people have not yet understood what kind of war is fateful for them too. Xiomara wants us to defend %STATION_NAME%, she has learned that the Civil Resistance is preparing an attack. Terrorists need a high-profile event to give themselves publicity. Of course, they will try to spread the word that Quasimorphosis actually exists. Well. We will make sure that they do not have this opportunity.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Def1.briefing	The Civil Resistance Colnodes have already penetrated the %STATION_NAME% perimeter. We'll drop you in the main strike zone. Immediately after the landing, take up defense. Sooner or later, the colonnades will retreat, you just have to hold out long enough.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Def1.objective0	Repel all attacks on %STATION_NAME%.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Def1.after	"%STATION_NAME% was and remains a symbol that the order of the Solar System has changed forever. The Civil Resistance can try as much as it wants to awaken the ""consciousness of the working masses."" Corporations are playing into our hands. We received a valuable artifact from Xiomara in gratitude for the work."
