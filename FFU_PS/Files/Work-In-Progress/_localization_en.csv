spaceobject.mercury.name	Mercury
spaceobject.mercury.orbitname	Mercury's Orbit
spaceobject.mercury.desc	In the 2150s, terraforming equipment was delivered to Mercury. The surface temperature is still far from adequate for humans. However, automatic stations can operate on the surface. The inhabitants of Mercury are robots. It is reported that humans can work in tunnels beneath the surface and inside mountain ranges. Some corporations are rumored to already have such colonies. <br><br>Quasimorphic status: Due to the weak presence of humans, Shartamakhum is almost inactive.
spaceobject.venus.name	Venus
spaceobject.venus.orbitname	Orbit of Venus
spaceobject.venus.desc	The planet was intensively terraformed at the end of the 21st century. All the power of a few wealthy corporations was directed towards this task. Bombardment with ice chunks, contamination of the soil with GMO bacteria, sowing of GMO seeds, and then colonization of GMO animals (mostly insects and spiders) were undertaken. Venus has been terraformed for 70 years. Moreover, people almost did not control the second stage of the process. The upper layers of the planet's atmosphere became a toxic hotbed (with the surface completely habitable) under which the jungle grew. Poisonous swamps still encircle the planet at the equator but otherwise, it is the most habitable after the Earth. <br><br>Quasimorphic status: the mass construction of cities under geodesic domes (geodesics) led to the awakening of Gannix and the widespread phasing of its elements on the surface of the planet. Quasimorphic activity here is extremely high, so all studies of this phenomenon here gave particularly effective results. Now the Quasimorphs of Gannix are full-fledged participants in the struggle for the Solar System, which is strictly hidden by the Hexarchy.
spaceobject.earth.name	Earth
spaceobject.earth.orbitname	Earth's Orbit
spaceobject.earth.desc	Earth is the ecological and agrarian paradise of humanity. According to the information from the SBN, the Earth is inhabited by 4 billion people. After the construction of New Seattle on the Moon and Intercity on Mars, the interdict mode stands on the planet. <br><br>Interdict mode: Only those market agents who are employees of corporations that have property on Earth or market agents that own such property have permission to visit the Earth.
spaceobject.moon.name	Moon
spaceobject.moon.orbitname	Moon's Orbit
spaceobject.moon.desc	"A satellite of the Earth, on which it is possible to extract helium-3 with high efficiency and produce quantum liquid H-3 from it. This is the fuel for cubecentric engines (the main engine type for spacecrafts). On the Moon, there is a huge pressurized city of New Seattle, which houses the headquarters and other buildings of a huge number of corporations. In New Seattle, there is the ""Source"" building, which houses servers that maintain the up-to-date text of the NCE and other related documents. <br><br>Quasimorphic status: Duggur is a dark and poorly studied Bramfatura. Quasimorphs on the Moon rarely attack New Seattle for some reason. However, there are rumors that the city is filled with secret cults, communities and circles. People do not understand what they believe in and whom they obey. There are rumors among PMCs that the Quasimorphs of Duggur are waiting for the right moment to rebel."
spaceobject.fuller.name	Fuller
spaceobject.fuller.orbitname	Fuller's Orbit
spaceobject.fuller.desc	An artificial satellite of the Moon. It orbits in a geostationary orbit and is constantly positioned over the Sea of Rains (Mare Imbrium). The satellite is named after Richard Buckminster Fuller, an outstanding architect, designer, engineer, inventor, philosopher, mathematician, writer, poet, and, most importantly, a hopeless utopian whose ideas had no chance of realization under the yoke of states. The liberation bestowed upon people by the Great Anarchist Revolution made the implementation of many of Fuller's ideas possible. This artificial satellite consists of five modules-stations interconnected by engineering structures and is a living embodiment of the dreams of an extraordinary individual.
spaceobject.mars.name	Mars
spaceobject.mars.orbitname	Orbit of Mars
spaceobject.mars.desc	"Mars was supposed to be terraformed first. However, Venus turned out to be more Earth-like than it was. Decisive aspect: mass. Any atmosphere from Mars is very quickly blown away by the solar wind. Terraforming equipment operates at maximum capacity, but all that humans manage to do is maintain the state of a cold desert, with GMO tundra islands growing closer to the equator. An acceptable level of oxygen and the ability to live without spacesuits makes people explore Mars. Separate bases of individual corporations are scattered all over the surface, reminiscent of the ""boomtowns"" of the Wild West. The only major city on the planet is Intercity. It was built even before the Great Anarchist Revolution, by the efforts of the richest states. The city was badly damaged during the GAR and was never fully restored. Intercity is a cold slum, over which individual corporate buildings rise like beacons in a world of poverty. <br><br>Quasimorphic status: For some unknown reason, there is no Quasimorphosis on Mars. Analysts note an anomalous number of missing people."

During the time of Venus' terraforming, Mechta became a convenient point for mounting structures and a loading terminal for planetary shuttles. Corporations threw garbage next to the Mechta. They attached constructions to it that could be useful later and forgot about them forever. As a result, Mechta became a huge improvised engineering art object. Its appearance was a surprise to everyone in the System. The size of the artificial satellite is so large that over time, its area has been put to good use by placing stations on it. The Venusian bramfatura influences Mechta; all stations here are subject to quasimorphosis.

The current claims of the returned Tezctlan to build the Emerald Empire run counter to Xiomaras vision. Taltnoms loyal to Xiomara are now united as the Feathered Masks Order.

Naturally this has dragged them into the faction war throughout the System.

Of course, they deny the very existence of censorship. This vocabulary is something from the distant state past. However, it is easy to censor and deny anything when you control the largest routers in the <color=#FFFEC1>System</color>. The actions of the hexarchs are associated with the appearance of Tezctlan on Venus. It will be easier for hard workers and middle managers to work if they do not know about the <color=#FFFEC1>monsters</color> that prowl around them. Because of our active participation in events we know something. The former assets of the destroyed concern <color=#FFFEC1>Fresco</color> on Venus became a battlefield between various forces and factions. The intensity of quasimorphic events on Venus is extremely high. Messages about it are coming from all the planets and satellites of the Solar System.<br><br>And then our old customer appears again - <color=#FFFEC1>AnCom</color>. We were extremely lucky to find that compact data bank at the Civil Resistance base. It seems that AnCom is hiding success in advanced experiments with quasimorphosis carried out behind the backs of the other hexarchs. <color=#FFFEC1>HIS “Unmasked”</color>, owned by AnCom, has been in the orbit of Venus for a while and is clearly engaged in a comprehensive study of its surface. And now they have shared something with us.<br><br>As we thought, accusing the <color=#FFFEC1>Civil Resistance</color> of fabricating quasimorphic activity on Venus is a lie. It seems that <color=#FFFEC1>Tezctlan</color> is trying to drag its “court” into our world: the quasimorphs of its bramfatura. There are reports of successful phasing of huge structures. But people like us have the opportunity to raise prices and start getting <color=#FFFEC1>real</color> pleasure.
mission.CommunityAndAnarchy.briefing	Our scanners can't trace the device, it is likely located somewhere in the underground levels. Look for the elevator down. The geodesic is partially destroyed, so we will drop you right on the territory of the colony. I'm noticing some other signals, but they're not quasimorphs. I think these are some poorly armed marauders: former <color=#FFFEC1>Fresco</color> Sec officers, fugitive PMCs, pirates who broke into the Inner System, and so on. Shouldn't be any problems.

mission.RuinsOfAncientBramfaturas.details	<color=#FFFEC1>Details:</color> Xiomara informed us that in the Sinkhole Oasis, a research colony on Mars, we can find an extremely valuable quasimorphic artifact. According to her, we can destroy Tezctlan with its help. If everything is as she says, this weapon will be our trump card in the big game that has begun in the System.<br><br><color=#FFFEC1>Additional Info:</color> Thanks to Xiomara, we have learned a lot about bramfatura and quasimorphosis. Xiomara is the Duchess of Gannix, the bramfatura of Venus, who is now at war with her kind. About 1000 years ago, Tezctlan became a hylonaut. This means he went to Earth, and such quasimorphs are no longer capable of escaping our native planet independently. Our analysts report that this happened around the 13th-14th centuries CE. When Tezctlan disappeared from Gannix, Xiomara took power there. With Tezctlan's return, the situation changed for her. Following Dr. Eipschwitz's lead, we drove her and her loyal knights, the Order of Feathered Masks, back to Gannix.<br><br>During one of our missions on Venus, Xiomara contacted us again. We made a deal and started receiving tasks from her. It helped the Feathered Masks survive in their fight against Tezctlan. It seems to be effectively curbing his activities.<br><br>Now she claims that in the Sinkhole Oasis, a geological research colony on Mars, we can find Tezctlan's spear. When we try to find out how it got there, the duchess vaguely mentions an ancient attack on Mars and the murder of its king. Our analysts speculate that this somehow relates to the absence of quasimorphosis on Mars. In any case, before unlocking all the secrets of the Sinkhole Oasis, we will have to deal with those who currently own it.
mission.RuinsOfAncientBramfaturas.briefing	The station is broadcasting something strange. Some prayers, chants, music... Human speech in... ancient Sumerian? That doesn't sound like RealWare. The station must be under attack. That's fortunate. In the chaos, we can get the shuttle a little closer than we planned. Attack the Sinkhole Oasis and make your way to the Monolith.

This is simultaneously a problem for us, the corporations, and even Tezctlan. They and Urparp haven't exactly had the friendliest of relationships. I'd like to ask Xiomara questions, but that's for you to decide, Boss. What's done is done. Mission accomplished.

Analytical information appeared in SBN that %STATION_NAME% represents a loss-making asset for %VICTIM_NAME%. This information is passed to %BENEFICIARY_NAME%. This is a very transparent signal for PMCs, a simple and clear task. We're going in, we're destroying anyone capable of holding a weapon, and we're off before this place becomes another branch of hell. Representatives of the customer will carry out the acceptance without us. By the way, almost forgot. Direct action is a solid reward. And a trusting relationship with %BENEFICIARY_NAME% won't hurt us at all."
mission.Corp_Corp_Capture1.briefing	There are 10 seconds left before landing. Clearing the station for capture is methodical work. Move slowly. As soon as the Security Guards or PMCs guarding %STATION_NAME% realize that the battle is lost, they will retreat or lay down their weapons. Usually, it is enough to destroy 50% of the combatants. Keep an eye on the indicators but if you feel that you have enough strength and supplies, then you can explore this place. Other than capture, nothing else is included in the contract, and the customer will accept %STATION_NAME% anyway. Well, traditionally: welcome to the world of healthy and fair competition.

Of course, this does not suit their competitors at all. It seems that it is %BENEFICIARY_NAME% who is interested in throwing %VICTIM_NAME% somewhere outside the Inner System. %STATION_NAME% can, for example, be bought. Any good deal requires a strong negotiating position. It is these positions that we will prepare for %BENEFICIARY_NAME%. The liquidation of an experienced manager would be a good step for %VICTIM_NAME% to look at %STATION_NAME% as a losing asset.
mission.Corp_Corp_Kill1.briefing	We've been given a personal target signature. First good news: it's in %STATION_NAME%. Sensors clearly show us him among the rest of the staff. Our shuttle will land where it can. After that, your work will begin. Moderate resistance is expected from the %VICTIM_NAME%’s SS or PMCs working for them. No difference, right? Eliminate the target - come back. Try not to get too distracted by studying %STATION_NAME%, this is not our priority task.

Apparently, %VICTIM_NAME% is about to have some sort of breakthrough, and if it happens, %BENEFICIARY_NAME% will lose market positions. We are expected to act cleanly: landing, searching for a target, and liquidation.
mission.Corp_Corp_Kill2.briefing	The signature of the target is visible on the sensors very clearly. It will not be difficult to identify it - the scientist will look like a scientist. White coat, smart face. They hold on to tradition so tightly that they don't need an ancap. They would also be happy with the caste system. We will land the shuttle at %STATION_NAME% where the defense systems will allow it. Move from level to level until you reach the goal.

If the %STATION_NAME% communication system, which ensures it works well with the rest of %VICTIM_NAME%’s structural elements, is hit, the losses will be strong enough to make the owner think about selling.

It seems that one of the field commanders is here - a key colony. It is clear why we appear in this whole story. %BENEFICIARY_NAME% has a special interest in this place, and if we want to gain their trust and a valuable reward, then we should take care of this idea champion.

The shuttle pilot does what he can but the Civil Resistance detected our approach early and activated countermeasures. We'll drop you where we can. The Civil Resistance has always frightened me somewhat. People go into battle not for profit, not for fun but because they think something is unfair. And are they people? Colnodes have always seemed very strange to me. You know, like the uncanny valley effect.

Of course, they won't say they've seized an asset from the Quasimorphs. As always, they will lie about the Civil Resistance. Our task is to make sure that they do not have an information occasion at all.

Killing Quasimorphs is what we know how to do.
mission.Tezctlan_Xiomara_Capture1.briefing	We don't know how some Quasimorphs manage to stay in our reality. Quasimorphs from planets other than Venus are always attracted by their bramfaturas. My point is that %STATION_NAME% is full of Quasimorphs. The sensors indicate that they are aware of the attack and are awaiting your arrival. Move methodically and, don't take unnecessary risks.

The Civil Resistance is sending active signals that they are ready to rid this place of further oppression and take power into their own hands. We can help by taking on this challenge. It is not so important how much we care about the happiness of the working people. We know that the Civil Resistance will not be left in debt. The task is simple: we go in, destroy all capable of holding weapons and set sail before this place becomes another branch of hell. Colnodes will appear when we are no longer in %STATION_NAME%.
mission.CivilRes_Corp_Capture1.briefing	%STATION_NAME% is at your complete disposal. Act methodically, the enemy is clear to you – this is your own security service or PMCs hired by %VICTIM_NAME%. Of course, one should not forget about the task: as soon as their losses become too great, they will leave this place. Watch the indicators so as not to be without the necessary supplies at a critical moment.

One of their satraps organizes a strategy to attack the stations and colonies liberated by the Civil Resistance. It is currently in %STATION_NAME%. We can help the Civil Resistance by taking out this man. At the same time, let’s try the %VICTIM_NAME% defense for strength. You cannot burden yourself with the responsibility for the struggle against the anarcho-capitalist regime of the System. We can work for a reward – the warehouses of the Civil Resistance are full of what they have expropriated from the corporations. We’ll definitely get something as a reward for our work.
mission.CivilRes_Corp_Kill1.briefing	The personal signature of the target was carefully handed over to us. The good news is that it’s in %STATION_NAME%. The sensors clearly distinguish him from the staff but the shuttle will land where it can. Then your work will begin. Moderate resistance is expected from the %VICTIM_NAME% SS or PMCs working for them. No difference, right? Eliminate the target – come back. Try not to get too distracted by studying %STATION_NAME%, this is not our priority task.
mission.CivilRes_Corp_Kill1.objective0	Search and destroy is routine work. Your target: the manager, usually not a combatant but he will be expected to shoot back.
mission.CivilRes_Corp_Kill1.after	%VICTIM_NAME% started an information campaign about the need to finally eradicate terrorism in the System. Maybe they want to make a retaliatory strike, and why don’t we take the job? A group of Colnodes delivered a reward for the work to the Magnum, fortunately, they have already set sail.

The Rebels would like to turn %STATION_NAME% into a base of operations on and around the planet. There is one reliable way to prepare a space station or colony for an invasion. If %STATION_NAME%’s communication system, which ensures it works seamlessly with the rest of the corporation's structural elements, is hit, then %VICTIM_NAME% will be forced to loosen its grip. The Civil Resistance will be extremely grateful to us if it is we who strike this blow.
mission.CivilRes_Corp_Sabotage1.briefing	The location of the communication center has been transferred to your map. Don’t be surprised it’s far enough away from you – had to maneuver.

Rebel agents have discovered that in %STATION_NAME%, %VICTIM_NAME% engineers are prototyping new equipment. If this prototype can be stolen, there will be no need to start from scratch. We can help the cause of the emancipation of the working class if we accomplish this task.

Here’s what we’ll need to do: walk through %STATION_NAME% and destroy as many Quasimorphs as possible. These creatures act on behalf of Tezctlan and it is not known how they learned to linger in physical reality for a long time.

Our analysts have uncovered this information, not without the help of the Quasimorphs themselves. Tezctlan has learned to bypass SBN filters. It constantly transmits messages to the network. The Hexarchy immediately declares them as fakes. An attack could start at any moment, and if we want to establish relations with the rebels, then it is worth helping them.
mission.CivilRes_Tezctlan_Def1.briefing	As soon as we deliver you to the place, the attack will begin. Sensors show that Quasimorphs have already appeared in some places in %STATION_NAME%.

mission.CivilRes_Xiomara_Capture1.details	<color=#FFFEC1>Details:</color> An event has occurred on Venus that the Hexarchy is doing its best to hush up. The Hexarchy immediately declares these messages as fakes from the Civil Resistance. The rebels have contacted us and urged us not to believe the lies of corporations. They want to enlist us to capture %STATION_NAME% from the Quasimorphs. After our victory, they will look for evidence there to present to all mankind the existence of Quasimorphosis. Here's what we'll need to do: walk through %STATION_NAME% and destroy as many Quasimorphs as possible. These creatures act on behalf of the Order of the Feathered Masks and it is not clear how they have learned to linger in physical reality for a long time. Even after we leave this place, the Civil Resistance will arrive and study %STATION_NAME%.
mission.CivilRes_Xiomara_Capture1.briefing	We do not know why exactly these Quasimorphs remain in our reality. Usually, the Quasimorphosis subsides shortly after the violence stops. This happens everywhere but not on Venus. So you have to work manually. After disembarking, methodically move forward through %STATION_NAME% and kill everything you see. Follow the indicators and try to be ready for any turn of events. Good luck.

They want to get this place but they are not yet ready for direct action. They can be understood. %STATION_NAME% is in the hands of Quasimorphs calling themselves the Order of the Feathered Masks. These Quasimorphs have somehow learned to linger in our reality for a long time. We can test their defense for strength. Civil Resistance agents have discovered that a duke-type Quasimorph has been spotted in %STATION_NAME%. If we manage to destroy it, then the forces of the Feathered Masks will be significantly weakened here. Of course, we are not doing this for reasons of helping the Civil Resistance. The rebels indicated that the PMC, which will undertake this work, will receive a good reward.
mission.CivilRes_Xiomara_Kill1.briefing	The sensors are almost completely blinded: we observe unthinkable jumps of Quasimorphosis. We'll drop you where we can. Your task is to kill the duke. Don't try to be a hero and clear the entire %STATION_NAME%, we have a clear task with clear conditions. Don't take unnecessary risks, save your strength. Remember that when you break through the ranks of the Quasimorphs, you will see the goal. Save your strength.

mission.CivilRes_Xiomara_Kill1.after	The Civil Resistance is not at all interested in the details. Colnode, who was in contact with us, barely perceptibly nodded and hung up. Let's hope that what awaits us in the cargo hold of the Magnum was worth it.

In this place, there is an object that most of all looks like a statue or an obelisk. This artifact is of Quasimorphic origin. All who study Quasimorphosis call it a ""reliquary"".

It won't be easy, the sensors indicate that the %VICTIM_NAME% guards are ready to attack.

This is a special entity that, when transferred from Bramfatura to physical reality, resembles a mineral. An igvalite is capable of accumulating gavwah, the energy that powers Quasimorphs. The energy of the artifact located in %STATION_NAME% catches the eye of Xiomara. If we want to serve the future Queen of Gannix, we must obtain this mineral for her.

The corporation needs a high-profile event to advertise on SBN. Of course, they won't say they've seized an asset from the Quasimorphs. As always, they will lie about the Civil Resistance. Our task is to make sure that they do not have an information occasion at all.
mission.Xiomara_Corp_Def1.briefing	The attackers have already penetrated the %STATION_NAME% perimeter. We have not yet figured out whether this is the Security Service or the PMC.

Sooner or later, the attackers will retreat, you just need to hold out for enough time.

Xiomara requires us to take part in this war on her side. The first step in our journey may be to capture %STATION_NAME%. This will help show our loyalty to the Feathered Masks. It will be necessary level by level to clear this place from the followers of Tezctlan. Killing Quasimorphs is what we know how to do.
mission.Xiomara_Tezctlan_Capture1.briefing	We don't know how some Quasimorphs manage to stay in our reality. Quasimorphs from planets other than Venus are always attracted by their bramfaturas. My point is that %STATION_NAME% is full of Quasimorphs. The sensors indicate that they are aware of the attack and are awaiting your arrival. Move methodically and don't take unnecessary risks. When their losses become too great, the survivors will run away. Xiomara will send her duke after you leave this place.

Perhaps the choice between joining the Feathered Masks or being destroyed is the only one we have. Now the master of the order is in thought. The Civil Resistance during one of the recent actions on Venus caused significant damage to the Quasimorphs. Now Xiomara turned her attention to the rebels. The hit was from %STATION_NAME%. We can help the Feathered Masks if we go there and can find Civil Resistance’s plans for future operations.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Espionage1.briefing	The Civil Resistance has turned %STATION_NAME% into a real fortress. This place looks like a continuous war zone. We'll drop you off where we can, and then you need to go on from there yourself. When you pick up the PCPU, return to the Magnum.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Espionage1.objective0	Task: pick up the Portable Computer Personal Unit (PCPU). After that, you need to return with it to the Magnum.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Espionage1.after	We deciphered the data from the PCPU, there really was a lot about the plans for the Civil Resistance on Venus. We passed all the information on to one of the dukes of Quasimorphs. Xiomara rewarded us with one of Gannix's artifacts, it is already aboard the spacecraft.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Def1.desc	<color=#FFFEC1>Goal:</color> Repel the attack of %VICTIM_NAME%.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Def1.details	<color=#FFFEC1>Details:</color> The Feathered Masks hold %STATION_NAME% firmly. It is Gannix's bastion in physical reality, evidence that Tezctlan cannot rest until the order is destroyed. However, people have not yet understood what kind of war is fateful for them too. Xiomara wants us to defend %STATION_NAME%, she has learned that the Civil Resistance is preparing an attack. Terrorists need a high-profile event to give themselves publicity. Of course, they will try to spread the word that Quasimorphosis actually exists. Well. We will make sure that they do not have this opportunity.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Def1.briefing	The Civil Resistance Colnodes have already penetrated the %STATION_NAME% perimeter. We'll drop you in the main strike zone. Immediately after the landing, take up defense. Sooner or later, the colonnades will retreat, you just have to hold out long enough.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Def1.objective0	Repel all attacks on %STATION_NAME%.
mission.Xiomara_CivilRes_Def1.after	"%STATION_NAME% was and remains a symbol that the order of the Solar System has changed forever. The Civil Resistance can try as much as it wants to awaken the ""consciousness of the working masses."" Corporations are playing into our hands. We received a valuable artifact from Xiomara in gratitude for the work."
